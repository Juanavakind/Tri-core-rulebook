Tri-Core is a tabletop roleplaying game that focuses on the creation and customization of unique characters, and storylines. Players will utilize the Tri-Core Ability Creation System to mold and craft all of their abilities and features that define their characters. As well as an intuitive resource system that will allow for an Action Economy that rewards both reckless and careful characters alike. The Tri-Core Combat System will enable players to also compete against one another through fair and balanced gameplay while simultaneously adding the much desired, element of surprise.

However, Tri-Core’s greatest feature is the Action Card System, in which Players will transcribe the abilities they create onto blank Action Cards and among those cards are Strike, Volley, Grab, Collide, Block, Dodge, and Parry. In addition players will have access to Utility Cards that provide actions to support their characters and the abilities they have. Each player, during a cycle, will place their set of Cards face down and reveal them on the same cycle. Allowing this gives the players a chance to access and utilize the element of surprise, even versus the GM(Gamemaster).

Players will pay for these Actions Cards with Action Points, Stamina, Focus, Mana and even Health Points (If necessary) to complete their actions and hope for success. Tri-Core can also allow for the transfer of abilities, features and spells from any source material using the Ability Creation System. However, the level in which these abilities may be acquired will not always be in alignment and Tri-Core does not deal in Absolutes. With that said, let it be known that in Tri-Core, everything has an equal chance to fail just as much as it can succeed. So thank you for choosing to play Tri-Core, and once more…

Thank you for choosing to play Tri-Core!
 
The Nine Core-stats for Tri-Core is Body, Mind, and Spirit. Body is split into Power, Vitality, Endurance. Mind is split into Intelligence, Acuity, and Finesse. Spirit is split into Ardor, Morale, and Attunement. Between Body, Mind, and Spirit these Core Stats are the base structure for all Character that determine the effectiveness of all Actions, Abilities and Equipment used in both Combat and Non-Combat situations. Which leads to rolling core stats, that’s where Character Creation will start.

They may decide to the Characters in their story should be like Superheroes and allow 9d10 or even 9d12 to be rolled for Characters.
 
Alternatively, a GM may not want players to roll stats at all and instead allocate their stats with a pool of points. If so, then 24 total points is what should be allowed for an array similar to what will typically occur when rolling 9d4.
 
The Standard Array for a level one Character is 9d6 and three +2
Bonuses at 1st Level, 5th Level, and 10th Level. A GM may choose to alter or modify the Standard Array rolled for newly created Characters as they choose, typically dependent on the campaign setting.
 
Players have the option of increasing their stats through a variety of ways, such as rolling and allocating stats, applying level up bonuses at 5th and 10th level, creating Passive Abilities that increase stats of their choice, as well as equipment they create or loot as they journey throughout the campaign.
 
Below is a list of Tiers that the GM may choose to change what stats are rolled for the Players as they create their character, representing a different scale in growth.
 
Commoner: An ordinary person, without rank or title – 9d4 and three plus one bonuses
 
Adventurer: A person who enjoys or seeks adventure and take risks, using various effective methods for personal gain. – 9d6 and three plus two bonuses
 
Heroic: A person who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities – 9d8 and three plus three bonuses
 
Legendary: A very well known and or extremely famous or notorious person, especially in a particular field. A living legend. – 9d10 and three plus four bonuses
 
Mythic: A person or thing having a perceived imaginary or unverifiable existence, that embodies an ideal or faith. – 9d12 and three plus five bonuses
 
Health Points or HP is what determines how much damage a character can take before they fall unconscious or even die. A characters total HP is an accumulation between Vitality, Endurance, Finesse, Ardor and Morale. Plus they gain 15 HP per level starting at level 1, and if they choose they may increase it through Abilities and Items. A character may suffer two effects if they receive too much damage in one instance. This is called a Threshold which is equal to 50% of their total Health Points. If they do, they must roll Resolve and the result must equal or greater to the total damage received. The type of Resolve rolled depends on the type of damage received. If they fail, then they suffer the effect, Shock. When in Shock, a character will lose their total Action Points regardless of how many Action Points they currently have.
 
Action Points or AP determines how many actions a character may take during combat, encounters or challenges. Each character has a base of 6 Action points plus the sum of Vitality, Intelligence, and Ardor. Any character may use Action Points beyond zero and dip into negative Action Points. However, they may suffer effects as they head to fatigue, exhaustion, and unconsciousness. For each point in negative Action Points, the character reduces their total AP once they use the Recover Action. If a character ever reaches their Total AP in negative AP, they immediately and unavoidably fall unconscious for 1d12 cycles minimum 1 cycle (duration reduced by Vitality). An Alternate Rule (GM’s choice) can allow characters to perform and complete Actions even when they are out of Resources such as Stamina, Focus or Mana. If they do, they will take backlash damage to their HP equal to 2d12 per Resource point used. (Backlash bypasses damage reduction)
 
Stamina Points or SP is what determines how many times an Ability Action associated with the Body Stat can be used per day. Each character has a base total of Power, Vitality, and Endurance.
 
Focus Points or FP is what determines how many times an Ability Action associated with the Mind Stat can be used per day. Each character has a base total of Intelligence, Acuity, and Finesse.
 
Mana Points or MP is what determines how many times an Ability Action associated with the Spirit Stat can be used per day. Each character has a base that total of Ardor, Morale, and Attunement.
 
Resource points are recovered (100%) at the end of a long rest (8 Hours or more), however, any character may make a short rest (4 hours) to recover half (50%) of their resources regardless of their current totals. Any character that suffered Shock or fell unconscious due to debilitating trauma will recover Resources at a reduced rate. They will only recover 50% after a long rest, and 25% after a short rest on the following day.
 
Whether it’s a Long Rest or a Short Rest, only one of each may be chosen per day. It’s up to the GM’s discretion on what constitutes the end of day and how many rests you’ll be allowed. Any action cannot be completed if a character lacks the resources, that includes additional resources or costs Abilities may have when created or chosen.
REACT, ROTATION & RESOLVE
React is an Action that allows any character to perform an Action in reaction to another Character. React costs 1 Action Point and is equal to the sum of Power, Finesse, and Attunement. React is also required when determining which character may take their turn first. This is called Priority and is given to the character at the top of the Rotation. 
 
A Character receives 1 Reaction plus an additional 1 Reaction per two points in Acuity.
 
The order of rotation is determined by highest to lowest in totals for rolled React. When a character has Priority, they can choose to perform one Action without expending an additional Action Point to do so. Any other character capable, may choose to React and perform an Action if they choose to. Any character, if capable, can perform a string of actions depending on the type of action and the costs. Being knowingly targeted by the Character with Priority, grants you a free Action as a reaction. A character may only React and affect another character that's within range of an Item, Equipment, Object, Ability or Action they have. 
 
As an example, Character A has priority and chooses to perform a Strike Action and Character B has been targeted by Character A. Character B is not required to spend an additional Action Point but is allowed one Action in reaction to Character A's Strike. Though Character B is not aware what action Character A will be taking. Character C is an ally of Character B and chooses to assist Character B by spending an additional Action Point to act out of rotation in defense of Character B.
 
Physical Guard (PR), Mental Fortitude (MF), and Energy Resistance (ER) reduce incoming damage and effects that align with the type of Effect Value (Physical, Mental, or Energy). PR, MF, and ER can be increased by Abilities, Armor, and Items.
Resolve is a reaction to effects that affect a Character in a variety but specific ways, and can be resisted through rolling a 2d12 plus a Core-stat and is determined by each individual effect. These effects can be produced by the environment or by another Character. (Resolve does not cost Action Points)
 
POWER: Effects that force a Character to move
VITALITY: Effects that modify Resources (HP, SP, FP, and MP)
ENDURANCE: Effects that modify Action Points
INTELLIGENCE: Effects that force a Character to use Action Points
ACUITY: Effects that modify a Characters Accuracy
FINESSE: Area of effects that require a Character's avoidance
ARDOR: Effects that modify a Characters Speed Rank
MORALE: Effects that modify Effect Values
ATTUNEMENT: Effects that modify a Characters sense & senses
 
The Challenge Level (CL) of a Resolve is determined by the total Core-stat plus 4 plus Character Level or Challenge Level, depending on the source of the effect. As an example, a level One Character with 10 in Body will have a CL of 14 and would require the Resolving character to roll at minimum 14 in order to resist the effect.
 
When a Character Succeeds or fails on a Resolve, the Effect is increased or reduced based on that success or failure. A critical success is determined if the characters resolve exceeds the CL by 20 or more. A success must be equal or greater, and no more than 1 to 19 points higher in total than the CL. A failure is 1 less or more, between 1 to 19 less than the CL and a Critical Failure is 20 points or lower than the CL.
 
CRITICAL SUCCESS: Effect reduced by 100%
SUCCESS: Effect reduced by 50%
FAILURE: Full effect
CRITICAL FAILURE: Effect increased by 100%
 
Damage mitigation applies when a character receives damage that targets Health Points or Action Points and only applies once damage is taken. Any Actions or Abilities that reduce damage taken such as Block and Dodge will reduce the incoming damage first and whatever is left over is reduced by Armor (Physical, Mental, and Energy). Damage received can be reduced to Zero and damage will affect Shielding and Temporary HP first before Health Points. Threshold is base total Health Points only and does not include Shielding or a temporary increase to Health Points.
 
UTILITY, STRIDE, & AGILITY
Recover is an Utility Action all characters have access to. Recover cannot be used as a Reaction, and can only be used on when a Character has priority. Recovery can be interrupted by a Reaction, and Recovery restores one selected Resource of the Players choosing. The resource is restored by a base of 1d6 plus 1d6 per two points in Vitality plus Ardor.
 
Hold is an Utility Action all characters have access to and it allows them to pass on their turn in the rotation and React instead to another action. They gain 1 Action Point and they will set a triggering event or circumstance with the GM and when the triggering event occurs they may then take the Action they held. The Action they held requires their Action Cards be placed face down and kept there until they decide to perform the Action on Hold.
 
Equip is a Utility Action that allows a character to equip or unequip an item, object or equipment (if applicable) for 1 Action Point(s) per weight. (Light, Moderate, or Heavy).
 
Stow is a Utility Action that allows a character to grab and place an item or equipment into a container for 1 Action Point(s) per weight. (Light, Moderate, or Heavy).
 
Drop is a Utility Action that allows a character to drop an item, object or equipment to the ground (if any) for 1 Action Point.
 
Use is a Utility Action that allows a character to use an item, object or equipment if capable for  1 Action Point(s) per weight. (Light, Moderate, or Heavy). The indicated use of an item is determine upon creation.
 
Speed Rank is what determines the amount of squares a character may move when performing the Stride Action. All characters have a base Speed Rank of 4 and is increased by 1 per 6 points in Agility. Each Square is 5 Feet in movement and counts for Horizontal movement. Vertical movement counts as two squares.  A Stride Action has varying costs and boosts or reductions to total movement depending on the type of Stride chosen. Speed Rank, like any other resource, is spent during a Stride Action. Vertical minimum height during a jump is equal to the Characters Agility and maximum height during a jump is limited to Power x2, plus Agility. 
Sprint is a Stride Action and costs 4 Action Points and increases Speed Rank equal to their Agility.
Run is a Stride Action and costs 2 Action Points and is equal to the character's Speed Rank.
Hustle is a Stride Action and costs 1 Action Points and is half the character's Speed Rank.
Walk is a Stride Action and costs 0 Action Points and allows 1 square of movement or 5 ft.
Prowl is a Stride Action, costs 2 Action Points, and limits movement to 1 Square per 4 Speed Rank. Prowl is a required Action to move while Stealthed, or using a Stealth Skill or retaining current Stealthed status.
Climb is a Stride Action and costs 2 Action Points and is equal to 1 Square per 5 Speed Rank.
Swim is a Stride Action and costs 2 Action Points and is equal to 1 Square per 6 Speed Rank.
 
During a Stride Action, Speed Rank is spent as a resource. Available Speed Rank can be increased or decreased based on the type of Stride Action used and cost of movement can be increased per Square based on environment and external effects and circumstances. As an example, if a Character has 15 Speed Rank and 6 Agility. Their Speed Rank increases to 21 during a Sprint, while they retain 15 Speed Rank during a Run. Their Speed Rank is 7 during a Hustle, and Speed Rank drops to 1 during a Walk. With 15 Speed Rank, a Character would be able to move three squares while Prowling, and Climbing and two squares while swimming.
 
STRENGTH, AND INTELLECT
STRENGTH, HOIST, AND ENCUMBERANCE: Strength is what determines how much weight a character can lift and move around. The total is an accumulation between the total of Body and Spirit . Each point of Strength allows the character to lift 20 lbs. of weight. This includes the weight of Items, Objects, and Equipment worn on the character at the time. A Character may try to move an object that weighs beyond this limit with a Resolve check equal to the difference. What a Character can lift, and the amount of Items and Equipment a Character can wear and hold on their person are two different categories. For Stowing, Equipped, and held items and equipment, a Character is allowed 10 lbs. per point in Strength, and for lifting a Character can lift up to 20 lbs. of weight per point in Strength.
 
As an example, with 15 Strength, Character A can lift up to 300 lbs. and wishes to push an object weighing 500 lbs. It's a 200 lb. difference and Character A would need at least 25 Strength to push it. That's a difference of 10 points in strength. So Character A has a Challenge Level or CL of 10 which is equal to the points per difference in Strength required to lift it. In order to do so, Character A will have roll their Hoist Skill and equal or exceed a CL of 10 with 10 Successes. Difficult, but not impossible. 
 
INTELLECT, SKILL RANKS, AND LANGUAGES: Intellect is what determines how many languages and trades a character may know and have access to. The total is accumulation between Mind and Spirit. Each point of Intellect is an additional Skill Rank, a new choice of Language or Specialization. A Specialization can be a skill or craft involved in Professions, Trades, and Careers. A Specialization can also be considered a Specialty with a Character choosing an Action or Device they want to increase by 1d12 per Rank. Such as a Swordsman, who increases the effectiveness of Actions when using a Sword.
 
Languages known allow a character to both read and write in the language they know and are considered fluent in this language when chosen. All Characters are allowed one free bonus Language they may choose, and each additional Language will cost one Skill Rank. Deciphering a Language and other Actions requiring the use of a Language skill allows a roll of 1d12 per point in Intelligence plus each Skill rank in a language associated with it. 
 
CRITICAL SUCCESSES: The result of an Action may be considered Critical for any action that rolls for Effect Value. When a critical is rolled, the effect value is increased by 50% and in various ways and an Action is considered critical whenever Accuracy exceeds the target by twenty or more points.
Strike: UPON A CRITICAL STRIKE, REFUND ACTION POINTS SPENT ON THE STRIKE ACTION
Grab: UPON A CRITICAL, DEALS AN ADDITIONAL TWO DIE WITH UNARMED COMBAT BONUS
Volley: UPON A CRITICAL VOLLEY, REFUND ACTION POINTS SPENT ON THE VOLLEY ACTION
Collide: UPON A CRITICAL COLLIDE, ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL MOVEMENT EQUAL TO HALF THEIR SPEED
Block: UPON A CRITICAL BLOCK, ALLOW FOR A BONUS STRIKE ACTION TO TARGET BLOCKED
Dodge: UPON A CRITICAL DODGE, ALLOWS FOR A BONUS STRIDE ACTION
Parry: UPON A CRITICAL PARRY, INCREASE RIPOSTE DAMAGE BY TWO DIE
 
OFFENSE & DEFENSE ACTIONS
Strike is an Offense Action that every character can perform and is a close range Action that deals either Physical or Energy damage vs. Health Points. A Strike can be used to damage Action Points, but only through created abilities, items, objects, and or equipment. A Strike Action receives a bonus from Power, and dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Strike Instinct. Additionally, a Strike Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.
 
Volley is an Offense Action that every character can perform and is a  ranged Action that deals either Physical or Energy damage vs. Health Points. A Strike can be used to damage Action Points, but only through created abilities, items, objects, and or equipment. A Volley Action receives a bonus from Finesse, and Accuracy dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Volley Instinct. Additionally, a Volley Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.
 
Grab is an Offense Action that every character can perform and is a close range Action that immobilizes and restrains opposing targets. A Strike can be used to damage Action Points, as part of the restraining feature draining 1 Actions Points per success. A Grab Action receives a bonus from Vitality, and dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Grab Instinct. Additionally, a Grab Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.
 
Collide is an Offense Action that every character can perform and is a momentum Action that deals either Physical or Energy damage vs. Health Points. Collide can used to damage Action Points, but only through created abilities, items, objects, and or equipment. Collide increases a Characters Unarmed Combat Die equal to Speed Rank  during the Collide Action. A Collide Action receives a bonus from Ardor, and dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Collide Instinct. Additionally, a Collide Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.
 
Block is an Defense Action that every character can perform and is a close range Action that provides either Physical or Energy Shielding vs. Health Points. A Block can be enhanced through created abilities, items, objects, and or equipment.  A Block Action receives a bonus from Endurance plus Power, and dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Block Instinct. Additionally, a Block Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.
 
Dodge is a Defense Action that every character can perform and reduces incoming damage equal to the sum of a Character's Attunement and Finesse. A successful Dodge action grants 1 square of bonus movement plus 1 Square per 4 points in Power and a Critical Dodge grants a bonus Stride Action. A Dodge Action receives a bonus from Attunement, and dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Dodge Instinct. Additionally, a Dodge Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.
 
Parry & Riposte is a both a Defense Action and Offense Action that every character can perform and allows the character the option to reduce incoming damage and follow up with a Riposte. A Parry  Action provides a shield equal to weapon or shield effect value and if the incoming damage is reduced to zero, the defending Character is granted 2 Actions Points and a bonus Strike Action versus the attacker . A Parry Action receives a bonus from Intelligence (bonus dice) , and dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Parry Instinct. Additionally, a Parry Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.  
 
In order to succeed at a Parry Action, the result from Parry and must match or exceed the incoming Offense Action or receive the Effect Value in full plus 50% from that Action (Remaining total). When choosing to Parry an incoming Offense Action, a success means the Action is negated and damage was never dealt. However, a failed Parry instead increases incoming damage by increasing damage received equal to the targets key stat bonus, and depending on the difference in results, can change their Attack into a Critical. A failed Parry does not change Action Point cost used for the Parry. Choosing Light affects the outcome of a Parry and choosing Heavy affects the outcome of the Riposte.
 
In reference to Block, and Parry: Chipping / Overload: If Block or Parry is overcome by 2x incoming damage, item may suffer: 1d6 + Power Durability damage. Parry is limited by weapon to weapon types, Physical and Energy. 
 
Additionally, When two characters Parry and Riposte successfully in sequence, a Chain Duel is initiated — a high-speed clash of blows and counters that continues until one party’s HP or AP hits 0, or someone fails a Parry or reaction. How It Works: Initiation: Character A makes a melee attack. Character B Parries, and Ripostes. Character A Parries the Riposte and returns another Riposte. Chain Duel begins. Chain Rules: Each exchange is a Strike → Parry → Riposte. All Ripostes must be Parried — you cannot Block or Dodge once the chain starts (unless you break the chain). Each reaction still costs 1 AP, and each Riposte follows the cost of a Light Action (unless a special trait increases it). Any missed or failed Parry ends the chain immediately — the attacker deals full damage. The first character to hit 0 AP or HP also ends the chain. 
 
COMBAT PHASES
Every Character will eventually find themselves in Combat, one way or another. Be it through an engaging conversation that took a wrong turn, with spoken words that ignited aggression. Or perhaps through zero precursor or context, such as an ambush by Bandits or Raiders raiding a defenseless village. Whatever the circumstance may be, Players and their Characters will enter combat and each Players, including the GM, must be familiar with the rules to keep gameplay steady and fair. As such, Combat is readily (and perhaps easier) understood through phases
 
PHASE ONE: ROTATION
Each Player must roll their React to see which of their Characters can act first in the rotation. They roll 2d12 and add their Power, Finesse, and Attunement and any enhancements included in their total bonus to React. The GM will sort these rolls out from highest to lowest, and any Players that end with an equal roll will determine who goes first between these Characters by comparing their Acuity. Whoever has the highest Acuity between the tied Characters will place them higher in the rotation. If they tie between their rolls and have equal Acuity, then they go at the same time in Rotation. Any Characters considered under stealth or are undetected through various and additional methods can choose to go first in the rotation but must declare to do so before actions are declared by other Characters. A hidden Character can choose to enter the rotation at any point, and that Character is inserted into the rotation and keeps that placement through the duration of combat.
 
PHASE TWO: ACTIONS
Once the rotation is determined, the Characters may begin declaring actions starting with the Character that acts first. All Characters receive a set of Actions they can declare, and each Action will cost resource based on Abilities & Equipment they may have created or acquired for their Character. All Characters are granted the ability to declare a Core Action (Strike, Volley, Grab, Collide, Block, Dodge, and Parry), Stride Action (Sprint, Run, Hustle, Walk, Jump, Climb, and Swim), Recover Action, and Utility Action (Hold, Equip, Stow, Drop, and Use). All Characters are allowed Three Active Actions in which they may use a Core, Stride, Recover or Utility Action in any order. Those Actions can only be used once per type per Cycle on your turn as Active Actions. However, as a Reaction a Character can use a Core Action, a Stride Action, and a Utility Action. But not a Recover Action, as a Recover Action can only be used on the recovering Characters turn. 
 
Additionally, a Character can use Trigger Abilities (Which counts towards the total allowed Reactions in a cycle) and may also React to other declared Actions. They receive one Reaction plus one additional Reaction in a cycle per 1 point in Acuity. Any Action declared that another Character is aware of, may React to it with an Action of their own. Reactive Actions do not need to target nor affect the Action they are Reacting to. Core Actions can be used an additional time; using an Off-hand device such as a Weapon or a Shield (Or any other applicable device). The Effect Value (EV) for Actions involving Damage, Heal, or Shield is increased by the Core Stat that applies to it. Such as Power for Strike, Finesse for Volley, and Ardor Collide. 
 
A Reaction is not required when a Character defends themselves from an Offense Action they are aware of that targets them directly or indirectly (Such as single target Action versus an Area of effect). Any Character can choose to defend themselves when attacked and must use a Defense Action (Block, Dodge, and Parry). Using any Action other than Block, Dodge, or a Parry to defend themselves does require that Character to use a Reaction in order to do so.

COMBAT PHASES CONTINUED
EQUIPMENT HANDLING (DUAL, TWO-HANDED, WEAPON & SHIELD):If a Character has an equipment in each hand, such as dual wielding Daggers, they can declare an action with both their main-hand and the off-hand with an increase to Action Point cost. Both weapon dice are added together and the total Action Point cost is increased for each weapon. As an example, if a Character uses a Moderate Strike action while wielding both a Mainhand and an Offhand Weapon, then his AP cost has a base of two, plus AP cost increases from both Mainhand and Offhand equipment traits. If the Mainhand is a Moderate Weapon, and the Offhand a Light Weapon, then presumebly the AP cost is increased by three, increasing the Moderate Strike Action Point cost from two to five. 
 
A Character with a Two-handed weapon or equipment increases the effect value bonus by 100% and the Action Point cost by two. Additionally, two-handed equipment also takes up two Equipment Slots, from the standard available Equipment Slots (Six). 
 
Characters using a Mainhand and a protective offhand item or equipment such as a Shield, does not use both items simultaneously in the same way as a Character that is dual wielding. A Character cannot use two different Action Types simultaneously, but using Abilities with the Trigger trait would be able to Strike and then use a Reaction to Block or Parry using their Shields' Effect Value.
 
SKILL ACTIONS IN COMBAT:
Skill Actions, however, are a mixture of Active Actions, Triggering Actions, and Passive bonuses. Active Skill Actions are as follows; Stealth, Crafting, Engineering, Observe, Channel, Clarity, Influence, and Meditate. However, Athletics, Hoist, and Traverse will trigger when an Action require that they apply their Skill Rank to it. As an example, lifting boulder would require a Grab Action (Lift) and in context, a Hoist Action to determine if the Character can lift beyond their means. However, if they wish to throw this Boulder, then they would need to use a Volley Action. If they were to fail their Hoist, then they could not lift the Boulder and thus not throw the Boulder using a Volley Action.
 
SUB-ACTIONS IN COMBAT
When declaring Active Actions, a Sub-Action can be added to modify the Action they declared. There are three types of Sub-Actions. Agility, Intellect, and Strength. Agility Sub-Actions are Tumble, Stealth, Balance, Freerun, Ruse, and Trickery. Intellect Sub-Actions are Examine, Veracity, Insight, Aim, Track, and Detect. Strength Sub-Actions are Break, Constrict, Lift, Advance, Charge, and Blitz. All Sub-Actions cost One Action Point, and all Characters have access to Sub-Actions.
 
PHASE 3: REACTION
Once the Player with Priority (It’s there turn in the rotation) has decided on which Actions they’d like to use, they may place their Action Cards on the table face down. They keep their Actions a secret to other players, and Actions and Abilities from opposing players may force them to reveal their actions. Otherwise, the Action Cards remain face-down. With or without revealing the Actions Cards placed face down by the Player with Priority, other Players may choose to place their Action Cards face down as well. Regardless of what their Actions and Abilities do, or who or what they target, all Players reveal their cards simultaneously. From this point, the 1st thing all Players involved must do is roll their React and a secondary Rotation is started. This rotation is tied to the Actions they are affecting. So, if the Character with Priority, namely Character A, has an Offense Action they are performing, such as a Volley Action. Then any Characters looking to React to that Volley Action would use their Reaction roll to determine who can react first to that Volley. So, let’s say Character A is targeting Character C, and Character B would like to defend Character C from Character A’s Volley. Character B, having rolled higher on React than Character C, can choose to step in the way and Block Character A’s Volley.
 
NEGATIVE HEALTH POINTS
If a Character suffers enough damage to go beyond zero Health Points, they are considered Wounded. Every source of damage received beyond zero Health Points worsens the Wounded Condition by one step. The required amount of damage received to worsen a Wounded Condition equal to that Characters Vitality. Each step in a Characters Wounded Condition weakens and enfeebles the Character significantly. A Character, despite reaching zero Health Points or less, may continue to remain conscious with a successful Resolve equal to the amount of damage they received (Most recent).

Every Cycle after the first a Character remains at 0 or less Health Points requires a Resolve at a -1d12 Penality which increases additively per cycle in Negative Hit Points. The type of Resolve is dependant on the type of Damage received, and the resolve type is between Physical Guard, Mental Fortitude, and Energy Resistance.

 Wounded I: All rolls made are reduced by two die, including; Offense Actions, Defense Actions. Physical Guard, Mental Fortitude, Energy Resistance, Unarmed Combat, React, and Speed Rank are reduced by 2.

 Wounded II: All rolls made are reduced by three die, including; Offense Actions, Defense Actions. Physical Guard, Mental Fortitude, Energy Resistance, Unarmed Combat, React, and Speed Rank are reduced by 4.

 Wounded III: All rolls made are reduced by four die, including; Offense Actions, Defense Actions. Physical Guard, Mental Fortitude, Energy Resistance, Unarmed Combat, React, and Speed Rank are reduced by 6.

 Wounded IV: The Character falls unconscious and begins dying. A dying Character must be resuscitated within 2 minutes, 120 seconds or before 240 Actions Points are spent by Characters with priority. Resuscitation, depending on the how the Character died, may be improbable or even impossible and the probability of success is to be determined by the discretion of the GM. 

 Resuscitation: A Character with Wounded IV may still be tended to and healed within a very short amount of time (2 minutes) and must be healed at minimum their total HP to be brought to zero Health Points. If resuscitated they remain at Wounded III until they have taken 2d4 days of Long Rest. Each count of successful Resuscitation (up to Three times) increases the required amount of days for Long Rest by 100% plus an additional 100% each attempt. Upon the Fourth attempt to Resuscitate, it automatically fails, and the Character dies and remains dead. Some Settings, based on the GM, may allow for Resurrection and other means of bringing Characters back to life.

 Coup De Grace: A Character may deal a finishing blow to another dying or dead Character preventing Resuscitation at the cost of 2 Action Points and the Action is considered a critical Strike Action. The targeted Character must be helpless, unconscious and either dead or dying.

Systemic Shock: In the moment a Character's Health Points and Action Points are reduced to zero in the same cycle, they afflicted with a condition called System Shock, which will render them unable to take actions for 1d4+1 Cycles. A Character afflicted with Systemic Shock can recover if both their HP and AP are restored to at least 1 point above minimum, which reduces the remaining cycles down to zero, regardless of how many remain. And they will recover at the start of their next turn, allowing them to take Actions again. Effect: They are not unconscious but staggered, reeling from simultaneous mental and physical overload. Narrative Intent: Represents a cinematic moment of collapse, such as being winded, stunned, or disoriented due to a massive blow—e.g., blocking a powerful attack that slips through and strikes the solar plexus. Clarification: It is different from Wounded IV (dying) and unconsciousness due to fatigue or negative AP alone. It occurs even if the character is technically still alive and above Wounded thresholds

 NON-LETHAL DAMAGE
 Throughout campaigns and storylines, combat is eventually going to occur or is otherwise inevitable. However, Players may decide to spare the life of an enemy or another Character for varying reasons. Allowing for Non-Lethal Damage to be dealt gives the Players the options of incapacitating their enemies and removing them from combat if they so choose.

 When inflicting Non-Lethal Damage or Non-Lethal Damage is inflicted, the HP of that Character cannot drop below zero. Non-Lethal Damage is only strictly inflicted with Impact, Electricity, Poison or Psychic Damage only. When making the choice to deal Lethal or Non-Lethal Damage, the Player must declare their intent before rolling dice for damage. If the Device used is designed for Non-Lethal Damage such as a Blackjack or a Taser, then the declaration need not be made, but instead informs the target or the GM of the type of Device they are using.

 Non-Lethal Damage cannot be inflicted with anything other than Impact or Electricity, and Unarmed Combat Bonus, unless modified through the Alter Keyword, always deals Impact Damage when used. Fire, as an example, can only burn and the flames eventually consume whatever target is set on fire. Slice damage will sever and lacerate causing blood loss which will eventually lead to death. 

 While a lot of sources of damage may appear to be of an element, the source of the damage does not determine the type of damage. Such as rocks falling onto a Character does not deal Earth Damage, but Impact. A wall of rushing water that slams into a structure is not dealing water damage, but Impact. 

 Once a Character is at zero HP, Non-Lethal Damage that is continuously inflicted turns into Lethal Damage and reduces their HP beyond zero as normal (Applying the Wounded Modifier). A Character must stop attacking to keep their HP at zero after dealing Non-Lethal Damage. A Character may accidentally go too far, and in these instances, it's fair to reduce the Characters HP beyond 0. Such as a Character who dual wields and successfully struck their opponent with the Main-hand and the Off-hand without knowing what their targets HP was at. 

As an example, Character A used their UCB to knock out Character B with successful consecutive punches.  However, after Character B was already incapacitated, Character A continued to Strike them turning the intended Non-Lethal Damage into Lethal and reduced their HP further into Negative HP.

IMPACT: UNARMED COMBAT BONUS, BLUNT WEAPONS AND OBJECTS
ELECTRICITY: CONTACT WITH SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY, TASERS, LIGHTNING STRIKES
POISON: VENOMOUS OR POISONOUS FLUIDS, ALOCOHOL, SEDATIVES, TOXINS
PSYCHIC: MENTAL ANGUISH OR FATIGUE INFLICTED BY POWERFUL PSYCHICS

Non-Lethal Damage is still affected by Damage Reduction, Energy Resistance, Dodge, Block and Parry as normal. As well as any other forms of mitigation and Non-Lethal Damage also reduces Shield in the same way it reduces HP.

CONDITIONAL MODIFIERS
Ligh Action: No change to effect value, cost 1 Action Point
Moderate Action: Increase effect value by two dice, costs 2 Action Points
Heavy Action: Increase effect value by three dice, costs 3 Action Points
Advantage: A Character increases the effect value of their Action by two die, if applicable, and only while they have advantage
Disadvantage:  A Character decreases the effect value of their Action by two die, if applicable, and only while they have disadvantage
Vulnerable: A Character reduces the effect value of all actions performed by two die while they are considered Vulnerable
A character becomes Vulnerable when they meet two or more Disadvantage conditions simultaneously (e.g., blinded and restrained). While Vulnerable, the character: Reduces the Effect Value of all Core-Actions by 2 dice. Cannot gain Advantage during that time. May be subject to additional effects (e.g., bonus damage, critical hits, or called shots) Example: A stormtrooper with one arm injured (Disadvantage to Strike and Block) and legs entangled in a snare (Disadvantage to Dodge and Collide) would now be Vulnerable, suffering -2 dice on all actions, and would likely be overwhelmed by even low-level attackers if not rescued or stabilized.
Stealth: A Character increases the effect value of their next action, while they retain stealth, by two die. 
Ruse: A Character increases the effect value of their next action once a Ruse has been successfully performed
Tumble: A Character receives a bonus to Dodge effect Value equal to Morale, and increases the cost of Dodge Action by 2 AP.
Charge: A Character increases their next Strike or Collide action by two die at the cost of 2 AP.
How to determine Advantage, Disadvantage, and Vulnerable Characters.
If a Character that targets another Character, this conditional modifier is then to be considered, by the context of each scenario. While thematically, a GM will have the authority to determine these conditions, as there may be context the PC's are not aware of. Advantage and Disadvantage will mechanically be determined, with no outside factors, by the status of a Characters senses, and available movement, and available anatomical devices(Such as limbs, eyes, ability to breathe etc). As well as positional advantages such as elevation, and difficult terrain. 
Possible impaired senses: Sight, Hearing, Smell, Touch, and Taste. Impaired sight will affect all Core-Actions, unless the Character has a way to "see" without direct vision. 
Impaired movement (Arms) will directly impact Core-Actions such as Strike, Volley, Grab, Block, and Parry. 
Impaired movement (Legs), will directly impact Core-Actions such as Collide, Block, and Dodge.
Impaired movement is a general term, it could be external or internal impairements, as an example, a broken leg would be internal, and legs bound with rope would be external.
Disabled devices such as hands, or feet, will pose a conditional modifier by preventing the Character from performing the action efficiently, or even at all. A character will be unable to use a Firearm with a broken hand, and may need to use their non-dominant hand to do so.  

NEGATIVE ACTION POINTS
For each point in negative Action Points, the character reduces their total AP once they use the Recover Action. If a character ever reaches their Total AP in negative AP, they immediately and unavoidably fall unconscious for 1d6 hours. 
Fatigue: A FATIGUED CHARACTER INCREASE AP COST WITH ACTIONS BY TWO POINTS
Exhaustion: AN EXHAUSTED CHARACTER INCREASE AP COST WITH ACTIONS BY FOUR POINTS

In Tri-Core, rolled dice "explode" when the maximum number is rolled and a bonus roll is granted using the die rolled previously. As an example, if 10d6 is rolled, and 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 3, 3, 2 and 2 is rolled. Then 4d6 bonus rolls are granted, and if 6, 6, 5, and 2 is rolled then 2d6 bonus rolls are granted. And so on... Exploding dice is to add a sense of luck, and fate for just not Accuracy but dealing damage.

These Tiers stack so long as each Obstruction are independent.

SPECIALTY: REQUIRED WHEN TAKING ACTIONS INVOLVING A CHOSEN TRADE
Specialty is a Mental skill that grants a 2 point bonus to Effect Value per Rank to Actions that use the chosen Specialties. As an example, if Character A chose Fire as their specialty than any action that uses the Fire sub-type will grant Character A  bonus +2 per Rank to the Effect Value. This bonus applies to Damage, Healing, or Shield as long as the Action uses Fire as its sub-type. An Action with a mixture of sub-types is subject to multiple points of Armor a target has.

Engineering, Profession and Technology are subjective to the setting the GM has chosen for their game, as some settings could be medieval and others could but modern or futuristic sci-fi. Due to this, some professions would not exist, such as a Farmer on a version of a dystopian Earth that no longer grows food on a field, but in a lab. Or a Crusading Knight, in Modern times where Knights no longer exist in the same status as you'd find them in their own era. This also applies to levels of Technology that simply do not exist in the 1200's such as Microwaves or Cars. Discuss with your GM what is available in the setting they have chosen before investing Skill Ranks.

SPIRITUAL SKILLS: All Characters have access to 5 different skills in the each category.

SKILL BONUSES & CHALLENGE LEVELS: Challenge Levels or CL and Skill Bonuses or SB represent the difficulty presented during a skill test. Specifically when Characters are using their skills in a manner requires them to. Such as Observe to detect an hidden enemy, or using craft to repair equipment. The CL is presented to a Character during a skill test, and and the SP is presented by Characters involved. 

CHALLENGE LEVEL (CL): BASE 10 PLUS 4 PER SKILL RANK REQUIRED PLUS MODIFIERS
Challenge Level is based on the level of the challenge and can be increased or decreased based on difficulty. like core actions, challenge levels also have light, moderate, or heavy.  a light challenge has its total deducted by 2, a moderate challenge is increased by 4, and a heavy challenge is increased by 6. A challenge level does not require a modifier, such as light, moderate or heavy and can remain as it is. A Level One Challenge has an unmodified base of 14, a level 2 challenge has a base of 18 and so on.

SKILLS VERSUS SKILLS: 1D12 BASE PLUS 1D12 PER SKILL RANK PLUS BOTH KEY STATS
Skills have a base of 1d12 per Skill Rank, and increased by the key stats relevant to the skill. as an example a level 1 character with key stat bonus equal to 8 and 1 skill rank will have a skill bonus of 1d12+8. they would roll 2d12 plus 8 with their skill and compare their results versus either another target or a skill challenge. in order to succeed, the total result must match or exceed their target. whoever initiates a skill challenge is on offense and the target is always on defense and a defender must match or exceed.

As an example, Character A is wondering around a Marketplace, browsing nearby vendors for items and equipment to purchase using local currency. They have a 4 in Acuity and 3 in Attunement, and 2 Skill Ranks in Observe. Character A's Skill Bonus for Observe is 9(ACT(4) + ATN(3) + Rank(2)).

Character B is moving through the same Marketplace area, with the intention of pickpocketing someone and will use their Stealth Skill in order to achieve this goal. They have 4 Vitality and 5 Finesse with 2 Skill Rank in Stealth and 1 Skill Rank in the Profession (Thief). Character B will roll 4d12+9 versus Character A's 3d12+7. Character B can roll a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 57 (Not including bonus rolls on a 12) on Stealth to successfully pickpocket Character A without getting caught versus Character A's minimum of 10 to a maximum of 43.

Character A rolled the following; 11, 7, and 4 plus 7. A total of 29.

Character B rolled the following; 11, 10, 6, and 2 plus 9. A total of 38

With a 38 result for Character B versus the 29 for Character A, B exceeded the A's by 9 points meaning Character B successfully pickpockets Character A and can acquire an item or equipment Character A had in their possession. The result of this thievery has limits and is set by the GM. Such as items and equipment that are physically attached to Character A. Which could make pickpocketing impossible or much harder to achieve.

The Trade skill is useful and apply a circumstantial 1d12 bonus to Skill Actions but is ultimately decided by the GM if the Action declared is compatible with the chosen Trades.

Skill Totals can be increased by Abilities, and Equipment that can further enhance a Characters capability and likelihood to succeed. Character B could have spent Focus Points to increase the total d12s in their Stealth roll or used Equipment to allow for a distraction which could have put Character A at a disadvantage. All things to consider when creating Characters and when declaring Actions.

PROFESSIONS AND TRADE: Each Character has the option to choose a Profession, or a Trade. A job they have acquired or have chosen for themselves that sets them apart in a unique and beneficial way. The Trade skill allows for flexible choices to be made that benefits a Character when they use the Actions they choose and apply to their Trade. A Trade applies to three different Core Actions, Skill Actions, Sub-Actions, Effect Value Types, and Device Types.

BELOW IS A LIST OF ELIGIBLE CHOICES FOR PROFESSIONS AND TRADES
CORE ACTIONS: STRIKE, VOLLEY, GRAB, COLLIDE, BLOCK, DODGE, AND PARRY
ELEMENTAL: FIRE, WIND, EARTH, ELECTRICITY, AND WATER
KINETIC: SLICE, PENETRATE, AND IMPACT

PHYSICAL SKILLS: ATHLETICS, HOIST, TRAVERSE, AND STEALTH
MENTAL SKILLS: CRAFTING, ENGINEERING, OBSERVE, TECHNOLOGY
SPIRITUAL SKILLS: CHANNEL, CLARITY, INFLUENCE, AND MEDITATE

A Character may choose any one of these categories listed as part of their Trade Skill, any of course may choose three categories per Trade. Such as the Strike Core Action and Swords. The Skill Rank applies to either one when used and cannot apply to both if they overlap. Such as a Strike using a Sword. Choosing Skills as part of their Trade applies the Trade Bonus to the total die granted to that skill while performing the desired Action

The Trade Skill can only be chosen once per five levels (1st, 5th, and 10th level.) When chosen, provides three choices as a bonus Skill Rank to those actions and adds to their total die. A Character cannot duplicate their Trade Skill Bonuses, such as choosing Strike three times for Swordsman. Bonuses from Trade Skills only applies to a total once, even if there are multiple sources of an applicable type. As an example, a Character with a Fire Sword, and an Ability reinforced by the Fire Sword does not apply a bonus twice, but once to the total.

SUB-TYPE AND DEVICES
DAMAGE: Reducing and or destroying a resource such as Health, Action Points, Stamina, Focus, and Mana
HEAL: Increase or restoring a resource such as Health, Action Points, Stamina, Focus, and Mana
SHIELD: Protecting or reinforcing a resource such as Health, Action Points, Stamina, Focus, and Mana
FIRE: Rapidly increases temperatures of Objects, Structures and Characters igniting them
WIND: The movement of air through heightened velocity, blustering Objects, Structures and Characters
WATER: Manipulating surrounding sources of water, as well as rapdily reducing a targets temperature
EARTH: Manipulating surrounding earthen elements such as dirt, rocks, roots, and vegetation
ELECTRICITY: Creating and generating an electric current and shocking conductive targets
IMPACT: Requires momentum and a blunted side of a device, allowing forceful contact towards a target
SLICE: Requires an physical edge on a device, allowing a target to be cut as a result from the Action
PENETRATE: Requires a point on a device, such as a Spear allowing the device pass into or through a target
TEMPORAL: The manipulation of time on or around a target by slowing down, speeding up or stalling time
LIGHT: Producing a bright and visible spectrum of light that affects targets in a variety of ways
DARK: egating the visible spectrum of light or producing darkness that confuses and befouls targets
PSYCHIC: Manipulating a targets consciousness and affecting them through mental invasion
POISON: Affect a target through contact, or ingestion with impairing alchemical substances
ACID: Affect a target through contact or ingestion with a destructive liquid chemical substance

Any of the sub-types available can affect the environments around a character, but are not required to deal damage to create hazardous effects. As an example, Character A has an ability that allows them to heal Character B but the Abilities sub-type is Fire. Character B has a flammable liquid near them that could ignite if it makes contact with a source of heat such as Fire.

While generally, all Sub-types are eligible to Damage, Heal or Shield a resource, thematically it may not always make sense. Communicate your ideas and concepts with your GM about unusual combinations between Damage, Heal, and Shield and a sub-type. Such as reversing time and undoing damage a Character may have taken using Temporal to Heal. Or creating a wall of Acid to damage and destroy incoming projectiles providing a shield for friendly Characters.

DAMAGE, HEAL, & SHIELD - EXPANDED
Increasing, decreasing, and otherwise modifying the resources of Characters is the basis of how Combat is conducted for all Characters. This can be done through a large variety of ways, such as through Actions, Abilities, and Equipment. But, in the end its done by dealing damage, healing, or providing shielding to Characters. However, not all Actions, Abilities and Equipment are eligible choices for including all three types as part of their effects.Not all Core Actions are eligible for the three Effect Value types available. A Strike Action can only deal damage, from a thematic standpoint it doesn't make sense to heal or shield someone by striking them. 

DAMAGE: Dealing damage is to reduce the resources of a Character through destruction. These resources include Health Points, Action Points, Stamina, Focus, and Mana. Effects that require damage to be dealt, requires at least 1 point of damage dealt in order to take effect.

HEAL: To apply healing is to increase the resources of a Character through restoration. These resources include Health Points, Action Points, Stamina, Focus, and Mana.Characters with Afflictions can be granted a Resolve if healed for at least 1 point of healing. 

SHIELD: To provide shielding is to protect the resources of a Character through reinforcement. These resources include Health Points, Action Points, Stamina, Focus, and Mana.Effects that require damage to be dealt, do not activate against a shielded Resource. Such as Afflictions.

When preventing damage through Shields as provided by Actions, Abilities and Equipment, mitigating traits that protect characters are applied first before reducing shield due to incoming damage. As an example, if a Character has Shielding of 4, and Armor of 2, an incoming attack would need to deal at least 7 points of damage in order to deal at least 1 points of damage to HP. The attack would start at 7, be reduced to 5 by the Armor and reduce the Shield by 4 with 1 point left over to be dealt to HP.

Damage, healing, and shielding can also be accomplished through equipment (items, tools, consumables and so on…) using the Utility Action that allows interaction with equipment in a Characters possession. Such as a shield projector a Character has to place into the ground, or a potion they have to imbibe to receives its rejuvenating effects. Items with a consumable effect have a quantity that applies to their number of uses, such as ammunition.
