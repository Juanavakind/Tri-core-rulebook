Section A
Tri-Core is a tabletop roleplaying game that focuses on the creation and customization of unique characters, and storylines. Players will utilize the Tri-Core Ability Creation System to mold and craft all of their abilities and features that define their characters. As well as an intuitive resource system that will allow for an Action Economy that rewards both reckless and careful characters alike. The Tri-Core Combat System will enable players to also compete against one another through fair and balanced gameplay while simultaneously adding the much desired, element of surprise.

However, Tri-Core’s greatest feature is the Action Card System, in which Players will transcribe the abilities they create onto blank Action Cards and among those cards are Strike, Volley, Grab, Collide, Block, Dodge, and Parry. In addition players will have access to Utility Cards that provide actions to support their characters and the abilities they have. Each player, during a cycle, will place their set of Cards face down and reveal them on the same cycle. Allowing this gives the players a chance to access and utilize the element of surprise, even versus the GM(Gamemaster).

Players will pay for these Actions Cards with Action Points, Stamina, Focus, Mana and even Health Points (If necessary) to complete their actions and hope for success. Tri-Core can also allow for the transfer of abilities, features and spells from any source material using the Ability Creation System. However, the level in which these abilities may be acquired will not always be in alignment and Tri-Core does not deal in Absolutes. With that said, let it be known that in Tri-Core, everything has an equal chance to fail just as much as it can succeed. So thank you for choosing to play Tri-Core, and once more…

Thank you for choosing to play Tri-Core!

Section B
The Nine Core-stats for Tri-Core is Body, Mind, and Spirit. Body is split into Power, Vitality, Endurance. Mind is split into Intelligence, Acuity, and Finesse. Spirit is split into Ardor, Morale, and Attunement. Between Body, Mind, and Spirit these Core Stats are the base structure for all Character that determine the effectiveness of all Actions, Abilities and Equipment used in both Combat and Non-Combat situations. Which leads to rolling core stats, that’s where Character Creation will start.
 
Power is the first Primary Stat listed amongst the nine Primary Stats available for a character. Power is apart of the Body Core Stat along Vitality and Endurance and affects total Stamina Points, Unarmed Combat Bonus, Melee Offense Bonus, Reaction, Strike Action, Athletics Action, Hoist Action, Strength, and Agility.

Vitality is apart of the Body Core Stat along Power and Endurance and affects total Health Points, Action Points, Stamina Points, Unarmed Combat Bonus, Grab Action, Stealth Action, Craft Action, Strength, Agility and the Recover Action.
 
Endurance is the third Primary Stat listed amongst the nine Primary Stats available for a character. Endurance is apart of the Body Core Stat along Power and Vitality and affects total Health Points, Stamina Points, Physical Guard, Block Action, Athletics, Traverse, and Craft Action, Strength, and Agility.
 
Intelligence is the fourth Primary Stat listed amongst the nine Primary Stats available for a character. Intelligence is apart of the Mind Core Stat along Acuity and Finesse and affects total Mental Armor, Action Points, Focus Points, Parry Action & Riposte, Mental Fortitude, Craft, Engineering, Technology, and Agility.
 
Acuity is the second Primary Stat listed amongst the nine Primary Stats available for a character. Acuity is apart of the Mind Core Stat along Intelligence and Finesse and affects Focus Points, React & Reaction, Traverse, Technology, Observe, Influence, Agility, and Intellect.
 
Finesse is the third Primary Stat listed amongst the nine Primary Stats available for a character. Finesse is apart of the Mind Core Stat along Intelligence and Ardor and affects total Health Points, Focus Points, Volley Action, Offense Range bonus, Stealth Action, Intellect, and Agility.

They may decide to the Characters in their story should be like Superheroes and allow 9d10 or even 9d12 to be rolled for Characters.
 
Alternatively, a GM may not want players to roll stats at all and instead allocate their stats with a pool of points. If so, then 24 total points is what should be allowed for an array similar to what will typically occur when rolling 9d4.
 
The Standard Array for a level one Character is 9d6 and three +2
Bonuses at 1st Level, 5th Level, and 10th Level. A GM may choose to alter or modify the Standard Array rolled for newly created Characters as they choose, typically dependent on the campaign setting.
 
Players have the option of increasing their stats through a variety of ways, such as rolling and allocating stats, applying level up bonuses at 5th and 10th level, creating Passive Abilities that increase stats of their choice, as well as equipment they create or loot as they journey throughout the campaign.
 
Below is a list of Tiers that the GM may choose to change what stats are rolled for the Players as they create their character, representing a different scale in growth.
 
Commoner: An ordinary person, without rank or title – 9d4 and three plus one bonuses
 
Adventurer: A person who enjoys or seeks adventure and take risks, using various effective methods for personal gain. – 9d6 and three plus two bonuses
 
Heroic: A person who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities – 9d8 and three plus three bonuses
 
Legendary: A very well known and or extremely famous or notorious person, especially in a particular field. A living legend. – 9d10 and three plus four bonuses
 
Mythic: A person or thing having a perceived imaginary or unverifiable existence, that embodies an ideal or faith. – 9d12 and three plus five bonuses

Section C
Health Points or HP is what determines how much damage a character can take before they fall unconscious or even die. A characters total HP is an accumulation between Vitality, Endurance, Finesse, Ardor and Morale. Plus they gain 15 HP per level starting at level 1, and if they choose they may increase it through Abilities and Items. A character may suffer two effects if they receive too much damage in one instance. This is called a Threshold which is equal to 50% of their total Health Points. If they do, they must roll Resolve and the result must equal or greater to the total damage received. The type of Resolve rolled depends on the type of damage received. If they fail, then they suffer the effect, Shock. When in Shock, a character will lose their total Action Points regardless of how many Action Points they currently have.
 
Action Points or AP determines how many actions a character may take during combat, encounters or challenges. Each character has a base of 6 Action points plus the sum of Vitality, Intelligence, and Ardor. Any character may use Action Points beyond zero and dip into negative Action Points. However, they may suffer effects as they head to fatigue, exhaustion, and unconsciousness. For each point in negative Action Points, the character reduces their total AP once they use the Recover Action. If a character ever reaches their Total AP in negative AP, they immediately and unavoidably fall unconscious for 1d12 cycles minimum 1 cycle (duration reduced by Vitality). An Alternate Rule (GM’s choice) can allow characters to perform and complete Actions even when they are out of Resources such as Stamina, Focus or Mana. If they do, they will take backlash damage to their HP equal to 2d12 per Resource point used. (Backlash bypasses damage reduction)
 
Stamina Points or SP is what determines how many times an Ability Action associated with the Body Stat can be used per day. Each character has a base total of Power, Vitality, and Endurance.
 
Focus Points or FP is what determines how many times an Ability Action associated with the Mind Stat can be used per day. Each character has a base total of Intelligence, Acuity, and Finesse.
 
Mana Points or MP is what determines how many times an Ability Action associated with the Spirit Stat can be used per day. Each character has a base that total of Ardor, Morale, and Attunement.
 
Resource points are recovered (100%) at the end of a long rest (8 Hours or more), however, any character may make a short rest (4 hours) to recover half (50%) of their resources regardless of their current totals. Any character that suffered Shock or fell unconscious due to debilitating trauma will recover Resources at a reduced rate. They will only recover 50% after a long rest, and 25% after a short rest on the following day.
 
Whether it’s a Long Rest or a Short Rest, only one of each may be chosen per day. It’s up to the GM’s discretion on what constitutes the end of day and how many rests you’ll be allowed. Any action cannot be completed if a character lacks the resources, that includes additional resources or costs Abilities may have when created or chosen.
REACT, ROTATION & RESOLVE
React is an Action that allows any character to perform an Action in reaction to another Character. React costs 1 Action Point and is equal to the sum of Power, Finesse, and Attunement. React is also required when determining which character may take their turn first. This is called Priority and is given to the character at the top of the Rotation. 
 
A Character receives 1 Reaction plus an additional 1 Reaction per two points in Acuity.
 
The order of rotation is determined by highest to lowest in totals for rolled React. When a character has Priority, they can choose to perform one Action without expending an additional Action Point to do so. Any other character capable, may choose to React and perform an Action if they choose to. Any character, if capable, can perform a string of actions depending on the type of action and the costs. Being knowingly targeted by the Character with Priority, grants you a free Action as a reaction. A character may only React and affect another character that's within range of an Item, Equipment, Object, Ability or Action they have. 
 
As an example, Character A has priority and chooses to perform a Strike Action and Character B has been targeted by Character A. Character B is not required to spend an additional Action Point but is allowed one Action in reaction to Character A's Strike. Though Character B is not aware what action Character A will be taking. Character C is an ally of Character B and chooses to assist Character B by spending an additional Action Point to act out of rotation in defense of Character B.
 
Physical Guard (PR), Mental Fortitude (MF), and Energy Resistance (ER) reduce incoming damage and effects that align with the type of Effect Value (Physical, Mental, or Energy). PR, MF, and ER can be increased by Abilities, Armor, and Items.
Resolve is a reaction to effects that affect a Character in a variety but specific ways, and can be resisted through rolling a 2d12 plus a Core-stat and is determined by each individual effect. These effects can be produced by the environment or by another Character. (Resolve does not cost Action Points)
 
POWER: Effects that force a Character to move
VITALITY: Effects that modify Resources (HP, SP, FP, and MP)
ENDURANCE: Effects that modify Action Points
INTELLIGENCE: Effects that force a Character to use Action Points
ACUITY: Effects that modify a Characters Accuracy
FINESSE: Area of effects that require a Character's avoidance
ARDOR: Effects that modify a Characters Speed Rank
MORALE: Effects that modify Effect Values
ATTUNEMENT: Effects that modify a Characters sense & senses
 
The Challenge Level (CL) of a Resolve is determined by the total Core-stat plus 4 plus Character Level or Challenge Level, depending on the source of the effect. As an example, a level One Character with 10 in Body will have a CL of 14 and would require the Resolving character to roll at minimum 14 in order to resist the effect.
 
When a Character Succeeds or fails on a Resolve, the Effect is increased or reduced based on that success or failure. A critical success is determined if the characters resolve exceeds the CL by 20 or more. A success must be equal or greater, and no more than 1 to 19 points higher in total than the CL. A failure is 1 less or more, between 1 to 19 less than the CL and a Critical Failure is 20 points or lower than the CL.
 
CRITICAL SUCCESS: Effect reduced by 100%
SUCCESS: Effect reduced by 50%
FAILURE: Full effect
CRITICAL FAILURE: Effect increased by 100%
 
Damage mitigation applies when a character receives damage that targets Health Points or Action Points and only applies once damage is taken. Any Actions or Abilities that reduce damage taken such as Block and Dodge will reduce the incoming damage first and whatever is left over is reduced by Armor (Physical, Mental, and Energy). Damage received can be reduced to Zero and damage will affect Shielding and Temporary HP first before Health Points. Threshold is base total Health Points only and does not include Shielding or a temporary increase to Health Points.

Section D
UTILITY, STRIDE, & AGILITY
Recover is an Utility Action all characters have access to. Recover cannot be used as a Reaction, and can only be used on when a Character has priority. Recovery can be interrupted by a Reaction, and Recovery restores one selected Resource of the Players choosing. The resource is restored by a base of 1d6 plus 1d6 per two points in Vitality plus Ardor.
 
Hold is an Utility Action all characters have access to and it allows them to pass on their turn in the rotation and React instead to another action. They gain 1 Action Point and they will set a triggering event or circumstance with the GM and when the triggering event occurs they may then take the Action they held. The Action they held requires their Action Cards be placed face down and kept there until they decide to perform the Action on Hold.
 
Equip is a Utility Action that allows a character to equip or unequip an item, object or equipment (if applicable) for 1 Action Point(s) per weight. (Light, Moderate, or Heavy).
 
Stow is a Utility Action that allows a character to grab and place an item or equipment into a container for 1 Action Point(s) per weight. (Light, Moderate, or Heavy).
 
Drop is a Utility Action that allows a character to drop an item, object or equipment to the ground (if any) for 1 Action Point.
 
Use is a Utility Action that allows a character to use an item, object or equipment if capable for  1 Action Point(s) per weight. (Light, Moderate, or Heavy). The indicated use of an item is determine upon creation.
 
Speed Rank is what determines the amount of squares a character may move when performing the Stride Action. All characters have a base Speed Rank of 4 and is increased by 1 per 6 points in Agility. Each Square is 5 Feet in movement and counts for Horizontal movement. Vertical movement counts as two squares.  A Stride Action has varying costs and boosts or reductions to total movement depending on the type of Stride chosen. Speed Rank, like any other resource, is spent during a Stride Action. Vertical minimum height during a jump is equal to the Characters Agility and maximum height during a jump is limited to Power x2, plus Agility. 
Sprint is a Stride Action and costs 4 Action Points and increases Speed Rank equal to their Agility.
Run is a Stride Action and costs 2 Action Points and is equal to the character's Speed Rank.
Hustle is a Stride Action and costs 1 Action Points and is half the character's Speed Rank.
Walk is a Stride Action and costs 0 Action Points and allows 1 square of movement or 5 ft.
Prowl is a Stride Action, costs 2 Action Points, and limits movement to 1 Square per 4 Speed Rank. Prowl is a required Action to move while Stealthed, or using a Stealth Skill or retaining current Stealthed status.
Climb is a Stride Action and costs 2 Action Points and is equal to 1 Square per 5 Speed Rank.
Swim is a Stride Action and costs 2 Action Points and is equal to 1 Square per 6 Speed Rank.
 
During a Stride Action, Speed Rank is spent as a resource. Available Speed Rank can be increased or decreased based on the type of Stride Action used and cost of movement can be increased per Square based on environment and external effects and circumstances. As an example, if a Character has 15 Speed Rank and 6 Agility. Their Speed Rank increases to 21 during a Sprint, while they retain 15 Speed Rank during a Run. Their Speed Rank is 7 during a Hustle, and Speed Rank drops to 1 during a Walk. With 15 Speed Rank, a Character would be able to move three squares while Prowling, and Climbing and two squares while swimming.
 
STRENGTH, AND INTELLECT
STRENGTH, HOIST, AND ENCUMBERANCE: Strength is what determines how much weight a character can lift and move around. The total is an accumulation between the total of Body and Spirit . Each point of Strength allows the character to lift 20 lbs. of weight. This includes the weight of Items, Objects, and Equipment worn on the character at the time. A Character may try to move an object that weighs beyond this limit with a Resolve check equal to the difference. What a Character can lift, and the amount of Items and Equipment a Character can wear and hold on their person are two different categories. For Stowing, Equipped, and held items and equipment, a Character is allowed 10 lbs. per point in Strength, and for lifting a Character can lift up to 20 lbs. of weight per point in Strength.
 
As an example, with 15 Strength, Character A can lift up to 300 lbs. and wishes to push an object weighing 500 lbs. It's a 200 lb. difference and Character A would need at least 25 Strength to push it. That's a difference of 10 points in strength. So Character A has a Challenge Level or CL of 10 which is equal to the points per difference in Strength required to lift it. In order to do so, Character A will have roll their Hoist Skill and equal or exceed a CL of 10 with 10 Successes. Difficult, but not impossible. 
 
INTELLECT, SKILL RANKS, AND LANGUAGES: Intellect is what determines how many languages and trades a character may know and have access to. The total is accumulation between Mind and Spirit. Each point of Intellect is an additional Skill Rank, a new choice of Language or Specialization. A Specialization can be a skill or craft involved in Professions, Trades, and Careers. A Specialization can also be considered a Specialty with a Character choosing an Action or Device they want to increase by 1d12 per Rank. Such as a Swordsman, who increases the effectiveness of Actions when using a Sword.
 
Languages known allow a character to both read and write in the language they know and are considered fluent in this language when chosen. All Characters are allowed one free bonus Language they may choose, and each additional Language will cost one Skill Rank. Deciphering a Language and other Actions requiring the use of a Language skill allows a roll of 1d12 per point in Intelligence plus each Skill rank in a language associated with it. 
 
CRITICAL SUCCESSES: The result of an Action may be considered Critical for any action that rolls for Effect Value. When a critical is rolled, the effect value is increased by 50% and in various ways and an Action is considered critical whenever Accuracy exceeds the target by twenty or more points.
Strike: UPON A CRITICAL STRIKE, REFUND ACTION POINTS SPENT ON THE STRIKE ACTION
Grab: UPON A CRITICAL, DEALS AN ADDITIONAL TWO DIE WITH UNARMED COMBAT BONUS
Volley: UPON A CRITICAL VOLLEY, REFUND ACTION POINTS SPENT ON THE VOLLEY ACTION
Collide: UPON A CRITICAL COLLIDE, ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL MOVEMENT EQUAL TO HALF THEIR SPEED
Block: UPON A CRITICAL BLOCK, ALLOW FOR A BONUS STRIKE ACTION TO TARGET BLOCKED
Dodge: UPON A CRITICAL DODGE, ALLOWS FOR A BONUS STRIDE ACTION
Parry: UPON A CRITICAL PARRY, INCREASE RIPOSTE DAMAGE BY TWO DIE
 
OFFENSE & DEFENSE ACTIONS
Strike is an Offense Action that every character can perform and is a close range Action that deals either Physical or Energy damage vs. Health Points. A Strike can be used to damage Action Points, but only through created abilities, items, objects, and or equipment. A Strike Action receives a bonus from Power, and dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Strike Instinct. Additionally, a Strike Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.
 
Volley is an Offense Action that every character can perform and is a  ranged Action that deals either Physical or Energy damage vs. Health Points. A Strike can be used to damage Action Points, but only through created abilities, items, objects, and or equipment. A Volley Action receives a bonus from Finesse, and Accuracy dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Volley Instinct. Additionally, a Volley Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.
 
Grab is an Offense Action that every character can perform and is a close range Action that immobilizes and restrains opposing targets. A Strike can be used to damage Action Points, as part of the restraining feature draining 1 Actions Points per success. A Grab Action receives a bonus from Vitality, and dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Grab Instinct. Additionally, a Grab Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.
 
Collide is an Offense Action that every character can perform and is a momentum Action that deals either Physical or Energy damage vs. Health Points. Collide can used to damage Action Points, but only through created abilities, items, objects, and or equipment. Collide increases a Characters Unarmed Combat Die equal to Speed Rank  during the Collide Action. A Collide Action receives a bonus from Ardor, and dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Collide Instinct. Additionally, a Collide Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.
 
Block is an Defense Action that every character can perform and is a close range Action that provides either Physical or Energy Shielding vs. Health Points. A Block can be enhanced through created abilities, items, objects, and or equipment.  A Block Action receives a bonus from Endurance plus Power, and dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Block Instinct. Additionally, a Block Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.
 
Dodge is a Defense Action that every character can perform and reduces incoming damage equal to the sum of a Character's Attunement and Finesse. A successful Dodge action grants 1 square of bonus movement plus 1 Square per 4 points in Power and a Critical Dodge grants a bonus Stride Action. A Dodge Action receives a bonus from Attunement, and dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Dodge Instinct. Additionally, a Dodge Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.
 
Parry & Riposte is a both a Defense Action and Offense Action that every character can perform and allows the character the option to reduce incoming damage and follow up with a Riposte. A Parry  Action provides a shield equal to weapon or shield effect value and if the incoming damage is reduced to zero, the defending Character is granted 2 Actions Points and a bonus Strike Action versus the attacker . A Parry Action receives a bonus from Intelligence (bonus dice) , and dice is increased by 1 per Skill Rank in Parry Instinct. Additionally, a Parry Action can be increased by the Trade Skill, Abilities, Items, and Equipment.  
 
In order to succeed at a Parry Action, the result from Parry and must match or exceed the incoming Offense Action or receive the Effect Value in full plus 50% from that Action (Remaining total). When choosing to Parry an incoming Offense Action, a success means the Action is negated and damage was never dealt. However, a failed Parry instead increases incoming damage by increasing damage received equal to the targets key stat bonus, and depending on the difference in results, can change their Attack into a Critical. A failed Parry does not change Action Point cost used for the Parry. Choosing Light affects the outcome of a Parry and choosing Heavy affects the outcome of the Riposte.
 
In reference to Block, and Parry: Chipping / Overload: If Block or Parry is overcome by 2x incoming damage, item may suffer: 1d6 + Power Durability damage. Parry is limited by weapon to weapon types, Physical and Energy. 
 
Additionally, When two characters Parry and Riposte successfully in sequence, a Chain Duel is initiated — a high-speed clash of blows and counters that continues until one party’s HP or AP hits 0, or someone fails a Parry or reaction. How It Works: Initiation: Character A makes a melee attack. Character B Parries, and Ripostes. Character A Parries the Riposte and returns another Riposte. Chain Duel begins. Chain Rules: Each exchange is a Strike → Parry → Riposte. All Ripostes must be Parried — you cannot Block or Dodge once the chain starts (unless you break the chain). Each reaction still costs 1 AP, and each Riposte follows the cost of a Light Action (unless a special trait increases it). Any missed or failed Parry ends the chain immediately — the attacker deals full damage. The first character to hit 0 AP or HP also ends the chain. 
 
COMBAT PHASES
Every Character will eventually find themselves in Combat, one way or another. Be it through an engaging conversation that took a wrong turn, with spoken words that ignited aggression. Or perhaps through zero precursor or context, such as an ambush by Bandits or Raiders raiding a defenseless village. Whatever the circumstance may be, Players and their Characters will enter combat and each Players, including the GM, must be familiar with the rules to keep gameplay steady and fair. As such, Combat is readily (and perhaps easier) understood through phases
 
PHASE ONE: ROTATION
Each Player must roll their React to see which of their Characters can act first in the rotation. They roll 2d12 and add their Power, Finesse, and Attunement and any enhancements included in their total bonus to React. The GM will sort these rolls out from highest to lowest, and any Players that end with an equal roll will determine who goes first between these Characters by comparing their Acuity. Whoever has the highest Acuity between the tied Characters will place them higher in the rotation. If they tie between their rolls and have equal Acuity, then they go at the same time in Rotation. Any Characters considered under stealth or are undetected through various and additional methods can choose to go first in the rotation but must declare to do so before actions are declared by other Characters. A hidden Character can choose to enter the rotation at any point, and that Character is inserted into the rotation and keeps that placement through the duration of combat.
 
PHASE TWO: ACTIONS
Once the rotation is determined, the Characters may begin declaring actions starting with the Character that acts first. All Characters receive a set of Actions they can declare, and each Action will cost resource based on Abilities & Equipment they may have created or acquired for their Character. All Characters are granted the ability to declare a Core Action (Strike, Volley, Grab, Collide, Block, Dodge, and Parry), Stride Action (Sprint, Run, Hustle, Walk, Jump, Climb, and Swim), Recover Action, and Utility Action (Hold, Equip, Stow, Drop, and Use). All Characters are allowed Three Active Actions in which they may use a Core, Stride, Recover or Utility Action in any order. Those Actions can only be used once per type per Cycle on your turn as Active Actions. However, as a Reaction a Character can use a Core Action, a Stride Action, and a Utility Action. But not a Recover Action, as a Recover Action can only be used on the recovering Characters turn. 
 
Additionally, a Character can use Trigger Abilities (Which counts towards the total allowed Reactions in a cycle) and may also React to other declared Actions. They receive one Reaction plus one additional Reaction in a cycle per 1 point in Acuity. Any Action declared that another Character is aware of, may React to it with an Action of their own. Reactive Actions do not need to target nor affect the Action they are Reacting to. Core Actions can be used an additional time; using an Off-hand device such as a Weapon or a Shield (Or any other applicable device). The Effect Value (EV) for Actions involving Damage, Heal, or Shield is increased by the Core Stat that applies to it. Such as Power for Strike, Finesse for Volley, and Ardor Collide. 
 
A Reaction is not required when a Character defends themselves from an Offense Action they are aware of that targets them directly or indirectly (Such as single target Action versus an Area of effect). Any Character can choose to defend themselves when attacked and must use a Defense Action (Block, Dodge, and Parry). Using any Action other than Block, Dodge, or a Parry to defend themselves does require that Character to use a Reaction in order to do so.

COMBAT PHASES CONTINUED
EQUIPMENT HANDLING (DUAL, TWO-HANDED, WEAPON & SHIELD):If a Character has an equipment in each hand, such as dual wielding Daggers, they can declare an action with both their main-hand and the off-hand with an increase to Action Point cost. Both weapon dice are added together and the total Action Point cost is increased for each weapon. As an example, if a Character uses a Moderate Strike action while wielding both a Mainhand and an Offhand Weapon, then his AP cost has a base of two, plus AP cost increases from both Mainhand and Offhand equipment traits. If the Mainhand is a Moderate Weapon, and the Offhand a Light Weapon, then presumebly the AP cost is increased by three, increasing the Moderate Strike Action Point cost from two to five. 
 
A Character with a Two-handed weapon or equipment increases the effect value bonus by 100% and the Action Point cost by two. Additionally, two-handed equipment also takes up two Equipment Slots, from the standard available Equipment Slots (Six). 
 
Characters using a Mainhand and a protective offhand item or equipment such as a Shield, does not use both items simultaneously in the same way as a Character that is dual wielding. A Character cannot use two different Action Types simultaneously, but using Abilities with the Trigger trait would be able to Strike and then use a Reaction to Block or Parry using their Shields' Effect Value.
 
SKILL ACTIONS IN COMBAT:
Skill Actions, however, are a mixture of Active Actions, Triggering Actions, and Passive bonuses. Active Skill Actions are as follows; Stealth, Crafting, Engineering, Observe, Channel, Clarity, Influence, and Meditate. However, Athletics, Hoist, and Traverse will trigger when an Action require that they apply their Skill Rank to it. As an example, lifting boulder would require a Grab Action (Lift) and in context, a Hoist Action to determine if the Character can lift beyond their means. However, if they wish to throw this Boulder, then they would need to use a Volley Action. If they were to fail their Hoist, then they could not lift the Boulder and thus not throw the Boulder using a Volley Action.
 
SUB-ACTIONS IN COMBAT
When declaring Active Actions, a Sub-Action can be added to modify the Action they declared. There are three types of Sub-Actions. Agility, Intellect, and Strength. Agility Sub-Actions are Tumble, Stealth, Balance, Freerun, Ruse, and Trickery. Intellect Sub-Actions are Examine, Veracity, Insight, Aim, Track, and Detect. Strength Sub-Actions are Break, Constrict, Lift, Advance, Charge, and Blitz. All Sub-Actions cost One Action Point, and all Characters have access to Sub-Actions.
 
PHASE 3: REACTION
Once the Player with Priority (It’s there turn in the rotation) has decided on which Actions they’d like to use, they may place their Action Cards on the table face down. They keep their Actions a secret to other players, and Actions and Abilities from opposing players may force them to reveal their actions. Otherwise, the Action Cards remain face-down. With or without revealing the Actions Cards placed face down by the Player with Priority, other Players may choose to place their Action Cards face down as well. Regardless of what their Actions and Abilities do, or who or what they target, all Players reveal their cards simultaneously. From this point, the 1st thing all Players involved must do is roll their React and a secondary Rotation is started. This rotation is tied to the Actions they are affecting. So, if the Character with Priority, namely Character A, has an Offense Action they are performing, such as a Volley Action. Then any Characters looking to React to that Volley Action would use their Reaction roll to determine who can react first to that Volley. So, let’s say Character A is targeting Character C, and Character B would like to defend Character C from Character A’s Volley. Character B, having rolled higher on React than Character C, can choose to step in the way and Block Character A’s Volley.

Section E
NEGATIVE HEALTH POINTS
If a Character suffers enough damage to go beyond zero Health Points, they are considered Wounded. Every source of damage received beyond zero Health Points worsens the Wounded Condition by one step. The required amount of damage received to worsen a Wounded Condition equal to that Characters Vitality. Each step in a Characters Wounded Condition weakens and enfeebles the Character significantly. A Character, despite reaching zero Health Points or less, may continue to remain conscious with a successful Resolve equal to the amount of damage they received (Most recent).

Every Cycle after the first a Character remains at 0 or less Health Points requires a Resolve at a -1d12 Penality which increases additively per cycle in Negative Hit Points. The type of Resolve is dependant on the type of Damage received, and the resolve type is between Physical Guard, Mental Fortitude, and Energy Resistance.

 Wounded I: All rolls made are reduced by two die, including; Offense Actions, Defense Actions. Physical Guard, Mental Fortitude, Energy Resistance, Unarmed Combat, React, and Speed Rank are reduced by 2.

 Wounded II: All rolls made are reduced by three die, including; Offense Actions, Defense Actions. Physical Guard, Mental Fortitude, Energy Resistance, Unarmed Combat, React, and Speed Rank are reduced by 4.

 Wounded III: All rolls made are reduced by four die, including; Offense Actions, Defense Actions. Physical Guard, Mental Fortitude, Energy Resistance, Unarmed Combat, React, and Speed Rank are reduced by 6.

 Wounded IV: The Character falls unconscious and begins dying. A dying Character must be resuscitated within 2 minutes, 120 seconds or before 240 Actions Points are spent by Characters with priority. Resuscitation, depending on the how the Character died, may be improbable or even impossible and the probability of success is to be determined by the discretion of the GM. 

 Resuscitation: A Character with Wounded IV may still be tended to and healed within a very short amount of time (2 minutes) and must be healed at minimum their total HP to be brought to zero Health Points. If resuscitated they remain at Wounded III until they have taken 2d4 days of Long Rest. Each count of successful Resuscitation (up to Three times) increases the required amount of days for Long Rest by 100% plus an additional 100% each attempt. Upon the Fourth attempt to Resuscitate, it automatically fails, and the Character dies and remains dead. Some Settings, based on the GM, may allow for Resurrection and other means of bringing Characters back to life.

 Coup De Grace: A Character may deal a finishing blow to another dying or dead Character preventing Resuscitation at the cost of 2 Action Points and the Action is considered a critical Strike Action. The targeted Character must be helpless, unconscious and either dead or dying.

Systemic Shock: In the moment a Character's Health Points and Action Points are reduced to zero in the same cycle, they afflicted with a condition called System Shock, which will render them unable to take actions for 1d4+1 Cycles. A Character afflicted with Systemic Shock can recover if both their HP and AP are restored to at least 1 point above minimum, which reduces the remaining cycles down to zero, regardless of how many remain. And they will recover at the start of their next turn, allowing them to take Actions again. Effect: They are not unconscious but staggered, reeling from simultaneous mental and physical overload. Narrative Intent: Represents a cinematic moment of collapse, such as being winded, stunned, or disoriented due to a massive blow—e.g., blocking a powerful attack that slips through and strikes the solar plexus. Clarification: It is different from Wounded IV (dying) and unconsciousness due to fatigue or negative AP alone. It occurs even if the character is technically still alive and above Wounded thresholds

 NON-LETHAL DAMAGE
 Throughout campaigns and storylines, combat is eventually going to occur or is otherwise inevitable. However, Players may decide to spare the life of an enemy or another Character for varying reasons. Allowing for Non-Lethal Damage to be dealt gives the Players the options of incapacitating their enemies and removing them from combat if they so choose.

 When inflicting Non-Lethal Damage or Non-Lethal Damage is inflicted, the HP of that Character cannot drop below zero. Non-Lethal Damage is only strictly inflicted with Impact, Electricity, Poison or Psychic Damage only. When making the choice to deal Lethal or Non-Lethal Damage, the Player must declare their intent before rolling dice for damage. If the Device used is designed for Non-Lethal Damage such as a Blackjack or a Taser, then the declaration need not be made, but instead informs the target or the GM of the type of Device they are using.

 Non-Lethal Damage cannot be inflicted with anything other than Impact or Electricity, and Unarmed Combat Bonus, unless modified through the Alter Keyword, always deals Impact Damage when used. Fire, as an example, can only burn and the flames eventually consume whatever target is set on fire. Slice damage will sever and lacerate causing blood loss which will eventually lead to death. 

 While a lot of sources of damage may appear to be of an element, the source of the damage does not determine the type of damage. Such as rocks falling onto a Character does not deal Earth Damage, but Impact. A wall of rushing water that slams into a structure is not dealing water damage, but Impact. 

 Once a Character is at zero HP, Non-Lethal Damage that is continuously inflicted turns into Lethal Damage and reduces their HP beyond zero as normal (Applying the Wounded Modifier). A Character must stop attacking to keep their HP at zero after dealing Non-Lethal Damage. A Character may accidentally go too far, and in these instances, it's fair to reduce the Characters HP beyond 0. Such as a Character who dual wields and successfully struck their opponent with the Main-hand and the Off-hand without knowing what their targets HP was at. 

As an example, Character A used their UCB to knock out Character B with successful consecutive punches.  However, after Character B was already incapacitated, Character A continued to Strike them turning the intended Non-Lethal Damage into Lethal and reduced their HP further into Negative HP.

IMPACT: UNARMED COMBAT BONUS, BLUNT WEAPONS AND OBJECTS
ELECTRICITY: CONTACT WITH SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY, TASERS, LIGHTNING STRIKES
POISON: VENOMOUS OR POISONOUS FLUIDS, ALOCOHOL, SEDATIVES, TOXINS
PSYCHIC: MENTAL ANGUISH OR FATIGUE INFLICTED BY POWERFUL PSYCHICS

Non-Lethal Damage is still affected by Damage Reduction, Energy Resistance, Dodge, Block and Parry as normal. As well as any other forms of mitigation and Non-Lethal Damage also reduces Shield in the same way it reduces HP.

CONDITIONAL MODIFIERS
Ligh Action: No change to effect value, cost 1 Action Point
Moderate Action: Increase effect value by two dice, costs 2 Action Points
Heavy Action: Increase effect value by three dice, costs 3 Action Points
Advantage: A Character increases the effect value of their Action by two die, if applicable, and only while they have advantage
Disadvantage:  A Character decreases the effect value of their Action by two die, if applicable, and only while they have disadvantage
Vulnerable: A Character reduces the effect value of all actions performed by two die while they are considered Vulnerable
A character becomes Vulnerable when they meet two or more Disadvantage conditions simultaneously (e.g., blinded and restrained). While Vulnerable, the character: Reduces the Effect Value of all Core-Actions by 2 dice. Cannot gain Advantage during that time. May be subject to additional effects (e.g., bonus damage, critical hits, or called shots) Example: A stormtrooper with one arm injured (Disadvantage to Strike and Block) and legs entangled in a snare (Disadvantage to Dodge and Collide) would now be Vulnerable, suffering -2 dice on all actions, and would likely be overwhelmed by even low-level attackers if not rescued or stabilized.
Stealth: A Character increases the effect value of their next action, while they retain stealth, by two die. 
Ruse: A Character increases the effect value of their next action once a Ruse has been successfully performed
Tumble: A Character receives a bonus to Dodge effect Value equal to Morale, and increases the cost of Dodge Action by 2 AP.
Charge: A Character increases their next Strike or Collide action by two die at the cost of 2 AP.
How to determine Advantage, Disadvantage, and Vulnerable Characters.
If a Character that targets another Character, this conditional modifier is then to be considered, by the context of each scenario. While thematically, a GM will have the authority to determine these conditions, as there may be context the PC's are not aware of. Advantage and Disadvantage will mechanically be determined, with no outside factors, by the status of a Characters senses, and available movement, and available anatomical devices(Such as limbs, eyes, ability to breathe etc). As well as positional advantages such as elevation, and difficult terrain. 
Possible impaired senses: Sight, Hearing, Smell, Touch, and Taste. Impaired sight will affect all Core-Actions, unless the Character has a way to "see" without direct vision. 
Impaired movement (Arms) will directly impact Core-Actions such as Strike, Volley, Grab, Block, and Parry. 
Impaired movement (Legs), will directly impact Core-Actions such as Collide, Block, and Dodge.
Impaired movement is a general term, it could be external or internal impairements, as an example, a broken leg would be internal, and legs bound with rope would be external.
Disabled devices such as hands, or feet, will pose a conditional modifier by preventing the Character from performing the action efficiently, or even at all. A character will be unable to use a Firearm with a broken hand, and may need to use their non-dominant hand to do so.  

NEGATIVE ACTION POINTS
For each point in negative Action Points, the character reduces their total AP once they use the Recover Action. If a character ever reaches their Total AP in negative AP, they immediately and unavoidably fall unconscious for 1d6 hours. 
Fatigue: A FATIGUED CHARACTER INCREASE AP COST WITH ACTIONS BY TWO POINTS
Exhaustion: AN EXHAUSTED CHARACTER INCREASE AP COST WITH ACTIONS BY FOUR POINTS

In Tri-Core, rolled dice "explode" when the maximum number is rolled and a bonus roll is granted using the die rolled previously. As an example, if 10d6 is rolled, and 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 3, 3, 2 and 2 is rolled. Then 4d6 bonus rolls are granted, and if 6, 6, 5, and 2 is rolled then 2d6 bonus rolls are granted. And so on... Exploding dice is to add a sense of luck, and fate for just not Accuracy but dealing damage.

These Tiers stack so long as each Obstruction are independent.

SPECIALTY: REQUIRED WHEN TAKING ACTIONS INVOLVING A CHOSEN TRADE
Specialty is a Mental skill that grants a 2 point bonus to Effect Value per Rank to Actions that use the chosen Specialties. As an example, if Character A chose Fire as their specialty than any action that uses the Fire sub-type will grant Character A  bonus +2 per Rank to the Effect Value. This bonus applies to Damage, Healing, or Shield as long as the Action uses Fire as its sub-type. An Action with a mixture of sub-types is subject to multiple points of Armor a target has.

Engineering, Profession and Technology are subjective to the setting the GM has chosen for their game, as some settings could be medieval and others could but modern or futuristic sci-fi. Due to this, some professions would not exist, such as a Farmer on a version of a dystopian Earth that no longer grows food on a field, but in a lab. Or a Crusading Knight, in Modern times where Knights no longer exist in the same status as you'd find them in their own era. This also applies to levels of Technology that simply do not exist in the 1200's such as Microwaves or Cars. Discuss with your GM what is available in the setting they have chosen before investing Skill Ranks.

SPIRITUAL SKILLS: All Characters have access to 5 different skills in the each category. Skills are independent actions that are required under specific circumstances in order to complete an objective set by the GM. All Skills, regardless of their category, combine two different stats for the bonus to rolls. As such, Skills receive a bonus equal to 2d12 plus Stat A + Stat B.  Each Rank in a skill adds a 1d12 bonus to skills when used and a Character receives Skill Ranks equal to their Intellect every 5 Levels.

SKILL BONUSES & CHALLENGE LEVELS: Challenge Levels or CL and Skill Bonuses or SB represent the difficulty presented during a skill test. Specifically when Characters are using their skills in a manner requires them to. Such as Observe to detect an hidden enemy, or using craft to repair equipment. The CL is presented to a Character during a skill test, and and the SP is presented by Characters involved. 

CHALLENGE LEVEL (CL): BASE 10 PLUS 4 PER SKILL RANK REQUIRED PLUS MODIFIERS
Challenge Level is based on the level of the challenge and can be increased or decreased based on difficulty. like core actions, challenge levels also have light, moderate, or heavy.  a light challenge has its total deducted by 2, a moderate challenge is increased by 4, and a heavy challenge is increased by 6. A challenge level does not require a modifier, such as light, moderate or heavy and can remain as it is. A Level One Challenge has an unmodified base of 14, a level 2 challenge has a base of 18 and so on.

SKILLS VERSUS SKILLS: 1D12 BASE PLUS 1D12 PER SKILL RANK PLUS BOTH KEY STATS
Skills have a base of 1d12 per Skill Rank, and increased by the key stats relevant to the skill. as an example a level 1 character with key stat bonus equal to 8 and 1 skill rank will have a skill bonus of 1d12+8. they would roll 2d12 plus 8 with their skill and compare their results versus either another target or a skill challenge. in order to succeed, the total result must match or exceed their target. whoever initiates a skill challenge is on offense and the target is always on defense and a defender must match or exceed.

As an example, Character A is wondering around a Marketplace, browsing nearby vendors for items and equipment to purchase using local currency. They have a 4 in Acuity and 3 in Attunement, and 2 Skill Ranks in Observe. Character A's Skill Bonus for Observe is 9(ACT(4) + ATN(3) + Rank(2)).

Character B is moving through the same Marketplace area, with the intention of pickpocketing someone and will use their Stealth Skill in order to achieve this goal. They have 4 Vitality and 5 Finesse with 2 Skill Rank in Stealth and 1 Skill Rank in the Profession (Thief). Character B will roll 4d12+9 versus Character A's 3d12+7. Character B can roll a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 57 (Not including bonus rolls on a 12) on Stealth to successfully pickpocket Character A without getting caught versus Character A's minimum of 10 to a maximum of 43.

Character A rolled the following; 11, 7, and 4 plus 7. A total of 29.

Character B rolled the following; 11, 10, 6, and 2 plus 9. A total of 38

With a 38 result for Character B versus the 29 for Character A, B exceeded the A's by 9 points meaning Character B successfully pickpockets Character A and can acquire an item or equipment Character A had in their possession. The result of this thievery has limits and is set by the GM. Such as items and equipment that are physically attached to Character A. Which could make pickpocketing impossible or much harder to achieve.

The Trade skill is useful and apply a circumstantial 1d12 bonus to Skill Actions but is ultimately decided by the GM if the Action declared is compatible with the chosen Trades.

Skill Totals can be increased by Abilities, and Equipment that can further enhance a Characters capability and likelihood to succeed. Character B could have spent Focus Points to increase the total d12s in their Stealth roll or used Equipment to allow for a distraction which could have put Character A at a disadvantage. All things to consider when creating Characters and when declaring Actions.

PROFESSIONS AND TRADE: Each Character has the option to choose a Profession, or a Trade. A job they have acquired or have chosen for themselves that sets them apart in a unique and beneficial way. The Trade skill allows for flexible choices to be made that benefits a Character when they use the Actions they choose and apply to their Trade. A Trade applies to three different Core Actions, Skill Actions, Sub-Actions, Effect Value Types, and Device Types.

BELOW IS A LIST OF ELIGIBLE CHOICES FOR PROFESSIONS AND TRADES
CORE ACTIONS: STRIKE, VOLLEY, GRAB, COLLIDE, BLOCK, DODGE, AND PARRY
ELEMENTAL: FIRE, WIND, EARTH, ELECTRICITY, AND WATER
KINETIC: SLICE, PENETRATE, AND IMPACT
SPECTRUM: TEMPORAL, LIGHT, DARK, AND PSYCHIC

PHYSICAL SKILLS: ATHLETICS, HOIST, TRAVERSE, AND STEALTH
MENTAL SKILLS: CRAFTING, ENGINEERING, OBSERVE, TECHNOLOGY
SPIRITUAL SKILLS: CHANNEL, CLARITY, INFLUENCE, AND MEDITATE

A Character may choose any one of these categories listed as part of their Trade Skill, any of course may choose three categories per Trade. Such as the Strike Core Action and Swords. The Skill Rank applies to either one when used and cannot apply to both if they overlap. Such as a Strike using a Sword. Choosing Skills as part of their Trade applies the Trade Bonus to the total die granted to that skill while performing the desired Action

The Trade Skill can only be chosen once per five levels (1st, 5th, and 10th level.) When chosen, provides three choices as a bonus Skill Rank to those actions and adds to their total die. A Character cannot duplicate their Trade Skill Bonuses, such as choosing Strike three times for Swordsman. Bonuses from Trade Skills only applies to a total once, even if there are multiple sources of an applicable type. As an example, a Character with a Fire Sword, and an Ability reinforced by the Fire Sword does not apply a bonus twice, but once to the total.

SUB-TYPE AND DEVICES
DAMAGE: Reducing and or destroying a resource such as Health, Action Points, Stamina, Focus, and Mana
HEAL: Increase or restoring a resource such as Health, Action Points, Stamina, Focus, and Mana
SHIELD: Protecting or reinforcing a resource such as Health, Action Points, Stamina, Focus, and Mana
FIRE: Rapidly increases temperatures of Objects, Structures and Characters igniting them
WIND: The movement of air through heightened velocity, blustering Objects, Structures and Characters
WATER: Manipulating surrounding sources of water, as well as rapdily reducing a targets temperature
EARTH: Manipulating surrounding earthen elements such as dirt, rocks, roots, and vegetation
ELECTRICITY: Creating and generating an electric current and shocking conductive targets
IMPACT: Requires momentum and a blunted side of a device, allowing forceful contact towards a target
SLICE: Requires an physical edge on a device, allowing a target to be cut as a result from the Action
PENETRATE: Requires a point on a device, such as a Spear allowing the device pass into or through a target
TEMPORAL: The manipulation of time on or around a target by slowing down, speeding up or stalling time
LIGHT: Producing a bright and visible spectrum of light that affects targets in a variety of ways
DARK: egating the visible spectrum of light or producing darkness that confuses and befouls targets
PSYCHIC: Manipulating a targets consciousness and affecting them through mental invasion
POISON: Affect a target through contact, or ingestion with impairing alchemical substances
ACID: Affect a target through contact or ingestion with a destructive liquid chemical substance

Any of the sub-types available can affect the environments around a character, but are not required to deal damage to create hazardous effects. As an example, Character A has an ability that allows them to heal Character B but the Abilities sub-type is Fire. Character B has a flammable liquid near them that could ignite if it makes contact with a source of heat such as Fire.

While generally, all Sub-types are eligible to Damage, Heal or Shield a resource, thematically it may not always make sense. Communicate your ideas and concepts with your GM about unusual combinations between Damage, Heal, and Shield and a sub-type. Such as reversing time and undoing damage a Character may have taken using Temporal to Heal. Or creating a wall of Acid to damage and destroy incoming projectiles providing a shield for friendly Characters.

DAMAGE, HEAL, & SHIELD - EXPANDED
Increasing, decreasing, and otherwise modifying the resources of Characters is the basis of how Combat is conducted for all Characters. This can be done through a large variety of ways, such as through Actions, Abilities, and Equipment. But, in the end its done by dealing damage, healing, or providing shielding to Characters. However, not all Actions, Abilities and Equipment are eligible choices for including all three types as part of their effects.Not all Core Actions are eligible for the three Effect Value types available. A Strike Action can only deal damage, from a thematic standpoint it doesn't make sense to heal or shield someone by striking them. 

DAMAGE: Dealing damage is to reduce the resources of a Character through destruction. These resources include Health Points, Action Points, Stamina, Focus, and Mana. Effects that require damage to be dealt, requires at least 1 point of damage dealt in order to take effect.

HEAL: To apply healing is to increase the resources of a Character through restoration. These resources include Health Points, Action Points, Stamina, Focus, and Mana.Characters with Afflictions can be granted a Resolve if healed for at least 1 point of healing. 

SHIELD: To provide shielding is to protect the resources of a Character through reinforcement. These resources include Health Points, Action Points, Stamina, Focus, and Mana.Effects that require damage to be dealt, do not activate against a shielded Resource. Such as Afflictions.

When preventing damage through Shields as provided by Actions, Abilities and Equipment, mitigating traits that protect characters are applied first before reducing shield due to incoming damage. As an example, if a Character has Shielding of 4, and Armor of 2, an incoming attack would need to deal at least 7 points of damage in order to deal at least 1 points of damage to HP. The attack would start at 7, be reduced to 5 by the Armor and reduce the Shield by 4 with 1 point left over to be dealt to HP.

Damage, healing, and shielding can also be accomplished through equipment (items, tools, consumables and so on…) using the Utility Action that allows interaction with equipment in a Characters possession. Such as a shield projector a Character has to place into the ground, or a potion they have to imbibe to receives its rejuvenating effects. Items with a consumable effect have a quantity that applies to their number of uses, such as ammunition.

Section G
ABILITY CREATION & ABILITY SLOTS
The Ability Creation System is the base for all Characters that are created through and exist in the Tri-Core System. Every Ability is created and modified through the Ability Creation System using Ability Creation Points (ACP) and Keywords. Each Keyword is unique with its own independent cost and each Character can have different types of Abilities. An Ability can be a Body, Mind or Spirit Ability. Which changes what resource using the Ability will cost. Stamina for Body, Focus for Mind, and Mana for Spirit. Each Ability requires an Ability Slot and each Ability will cost 1 Resource per Ability Slot used, up to two. 

Each Ability as it's created, starts with a Name, Root, Cost, Type, Spectrum, Aspect, Sub-Stat, Device, Range, Duration, Target, Effect Value, and a Description. Once all of these have been chosen and filled in, and the ACP Cost is paid then the Ability may be acquired by the Character that created it.

NAME: Almost as important as what it does, it's how a Character declares what Ability they are using.
COST: Body, Mind or Spirit determines the Cost and what Sub-Stat is available for use.
TYPE: 'Active, Trigger, or Passive; determines when the Ability can be used.
ASPECT: 'Damage, Heal, Shield, Boost or Hinderance; determines how it affects the Target.
DEVICE: 'Required availability and functionality in order for the Ability to be used.
RANGE: 'Determines what targets are eligible as long as they are within range of the user.
TARGET: 'Natural, Self, or Single Target determines what other Characters can be chosen.
EFFECT VALUE: 'Determines the result of the Ability based on what Keywords the Character chose.
KEYWORDS: 'The Keywords create a structure for the Ability and provides limitations based on ACP Investment.
DESCRIPTION: 'Important for the Characters theme and concept as the design is governed by it.

All Characters are allowed a limited amount of Ability Slots to which they choose a Slot, create an Ability for that Slot. There are three types of Ability Slots a Character may acquire; An Active Ability, a Trigger Ability and a Passive Ability. A Character is granted 10 Ability Slots at 1st Level, 2 Ability Slots at 2nd Level, and 1 Ability slot per level there-after. At level 19 an additional 3 Ability slots are granted, and another 5 Ability slots at level 20. In total, a Character will have 36 Ability Slots available to them by level 20. Each Ability Slot is granted ACP equal to double the total in Body, Mind, or Spirit plus 10 per Character Level. Additionally, a Character may give up Equipment Slots and add another Ability Slot instead. 

ACTIVE: 'Can be used in place of any Core Action available to Characters (Such as Strike or Dodge).
TRIGGER: 'Can be used at any time, when the Triggering event occurs. Resource cost is doubled.
PASSIVE: 'Does not cost Resource or Action Points and remains in effect at all times.

Active, Trigger, and Passive Abilities are Ability Types that affect the cost of Keywords and determine what resources apply to those Abilities. Active Abilities have no increase or decrease to Keywords Costs, and cost Action Points based on Weight and Resource based on ABS. Trigger Abilities cost the same as Active Abilities and have no Action Point Cost, but increases Resource Point cost and Passive Abilities increase Keyword Cost by 100%, but costs zero Action Points, and zero Resources and have a permanent duration. Active Abilities, as the name implies, are actively used by Characters when taking Actions. Trigger Abilities can only be activated and used when the circumstance the player established occurs. Passive Abilities are always in effect. A Character cannot benefit from multiple Boosts of the same type, such as an increase to damage dealt, or an increase to Maximum HP. The most recently used Boost replaces the previous, regardless of its comparable potency.

COST & KEYWORDS
Each Character gets three different totals for their Ability Creation Points (ACP) equal to a starting Base Amount of 15 plus 5 per level and the total in each Core (Body, Mind, and Spirit). Allowing them to spend up the total in ACP on a Single Ability Slot and twice that amount on a Double Ability Slot. They can choose Keywords and spend ACP on them in any way that they choose. Enhancements to Core Stats does not contribute to total available ACP.
 
However, there are limitations to what they Keywords can increase & decrease, and their effects may not stack, depending on how they affect the Characters. As an example, increasing the Damage dealt with a Strike Action can only be increased a limited amount of times. But cannot have its damage increased with multiple instances of Passive Abilities. It can only be increased Once per type of Ability Slot. Boost and Hinder, as they are referred to, is how Actions & Abilities are increased or decreased and can only be done so with Active Abilities, Triggering Abilities, Passive Abilities, and or Items & Equipment.

As an example, let’s say Character A sees an opportunity to takedown an opponent with a finishing blow but wants to take no chances. Character A decides to use multiple resources in order to increase the damage dealt as much as possible. So, with a Strike Action, following a Parry, Character A boosts the Riposte with what Character A calls “Surge”. Character A has an Active, Trigger, and Passive version of Surge to maximize the potential for this attack. But Character A is Level One and has 30 ACP Available, and each one of these Abilities are Double Slots. Character A increases the damage of the Riposte with the Passive by 1d12+1 (70 ACP), the Triggering Surge is set to activate upon a successful Parry and thus increases the damage further by 3d12(60 ACP) and the Active Surge (Activated in a previous turn with a Duration of 3 cycles) increases the Damage of their next Strike Action by 3d12(60 ACP). Allowing Character A to increase the damage of their Unarmed Combat Bonus (Which is already 4d12) by 7d12 giving Character A an Attack that deals 11d12 points of damage with 6 Ability Slots invested at the cost of 4 Stamina and 4 Action Points. As its a Riposte following a Heavy Parry, that’s 11d12+2d12(Heavy)+3d12(INT) resulting in 16d12 as a massive Riposte which would be devastating to their target. Which places this finishing blow in the ball park of  (Zero to Thirty-two Impact Damage). Well worth the resources and Ability Slots invested.

Now, while that seems like a lot (and it is), Character A invested a lot to accomplish such a heavy-handed hit. What happens to Character B when struck and what could they do to avoid being taken down so easily? Let’s presume Character B is a defensive Character. They may be able to avoid the Knockout Punch for much less investment. Perhaps Character B invested a Double Ability Slot to increase their Max HP by 5 and have a Triggering Ability that grants 10 temporary HP when taking damage. Then, just to ensure survival, Character B has an active Ability that provides Shielding equal to 10 for 3 cycles. So, for 2 Stamina, 2 Action Points and 4 Ability Slots, Character B can absorb up to 7 points of damage with a Block while having 25 more HP than Character A. Meaning, that 32 points of Damage Character A could do, still has to get through Character B’s HP & Armor. So, while maximizing the potential of an Attack can be very intimidating, there are many ways to mitigate and otherwise neutralize incoming attacks.

There can be a lot to consider and a lot of conditional modifiers that can drastically change the outcome of a conflict between two opposing Characters. Such as the one described above. For example, perhaps Character A rolled very poorly on their Accuracy and missed the Parry all-together, despite having an advantage on Accuracy die. Or if Character B had already sustained a lot of damage, and was left with only 5 HP Left. Character needs only 5 damage to overcome Character B's defenses to potentially end the conflict all-together (80 Damage dealt). Additionally, if Character A's damage dealt had the Electricity Sub-Type, and Character B had instead used the Block Action with the Water Sub-Type, reducing incoming Fire Damage by 50% while simultaneously being able to absorb 75 incoming damage.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ARE ALL THE KEYWORD ENTRIES THAT ALLOW PLAYERS TO CREATE AND CRAFT ABILITIES AND EQUIPMENT
ALL AFFLICTIONS EFFECTS ARE ACTIVATED WHEN DEALING DAMAGE WITH A SPECIFIC DAMAGE TYPE. ALL COSTS 20 ACP PER AFFLICTION
AFFLICTION I: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH BURN WHEN DEALING FIRE DAMAGE
Every 1 die rolled will build up 1 point of Fire Damage and be dealt at the start of the Characters next cycle. The Afflicted Character may roll Energy Resistance Resolve versus Legerity to reduce the Burning Affliction by Half the total amount rounded down. If the Burning Affliction is down to 1 damage, than only one resolve need be rolled. Resolve must be rolled until the Burning Affliction reaches 1 die and then zero. Every Cycle that Burning continues to Afflict a Character, the total amount of Burning dice grows by 1 point of damage. 

AFFLICTION II: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH FREEZE WHEN DEALING WATER DAMAGE
Every 2 Dice rolled reduces Speed Rank by 1. The Freezing Affliction can be resisted with an Energy Resistance Resolve versus Legerity which reduces the Affliction Speed Rank Penalty by Half (1 minimum) and can be negated with a successful resolve once the Speed Rank Penalty is at 1. Every cycle the Freeze Affliction is not reduced, the Speed Rank Penalty grows by 1. A Character is considered immobilized once they reach zero Speed Rank.

AFFLICTION III: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH SOAK WHEN DEALING WATER DAMAGE
Every 2 Dice rolled will increase Action Point costs by 1 while under the Soaked Affliction. The Soak Affliction can be resisted with a Physical Guard Resolve versus Legerity. The Soak Affliction’s severity is wornsened by environmental hazards such as any body of water large enough to completely envelope an Afflicted Character by one step per cycle they remain in it. Additionally, the Character is weighed down by 25 lbs. per step in the Affliction. Example: A Character at three steps would have a AP cost penalty of 3 and weigh an additional 75 lbs. 

AFFLICTION IV: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH BLUSTER WHEN DEALING WIND DAMAGE
Every 2 Dice rolled push, lifts and pulls all Characters afflicted 2 Squares. The Blustering Affliction can be resisted with a Physical Guard Resolve versus Legerity which reduces the forced movement by half (minimum 1). The Bluster Affliction is negated with a Resolve if the forced movement reduced to zero squares. If a Blustered Target collides with another Character, Object, or Structure then they take one additional point of Impact damage per square that they traveled.

AFFLICTION V: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH CRUSH WHEN DEALING EARTH DAMAGE
Every 4 Dice rolled will apply 1 additional die to be rolled and then deals damage to items and equipment the Character may be holding, wielding, and wearing. If the Character either has no items or equipment, or the they have been destroyed by Crushing Damage then the Character takes that damage instead. The Crush Affliction can be avoided by a Finesse Resolve, if Afflicted, then it becomes a Power Resolve to end the Affliction. Some Crush Afflictions are not persistent, and only applied the Instant the Damage is received and ends simultaneously.

AFFLICTION VI: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH JOLT WHEN DEALING ELECTRICITY DAMAGE
Every 2 Dice rolled will destroy 1 Action Point. The Jolt Affliction can be resisted with an Energy Resistance Resolve versus Legerity. A Jolt Affliction can be persistent so long as the Character continues contact with a source of Electricity. If a Character remains in contact with an Electrical Source, each increases the Affliction step by one, and if at full negative Action Points will remain in contact unless removed by another means. If no Action Points remain, the Afflicted Character instead takes damage to their Health Points equal to double the Action Points they would have lost.

AFFLICTION VII: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH MELT WHEN DEALING ACID DAMAGE
Every 2 Dice rolled will deal 1 additional point of damage versus the Durability of Items and Equipment. The Melt Affliction can be negated by a Physical Guard Resolve. The Melt Affliction reduces Armor and Shield of Creatures, Items, Equipment, Objects and Structures by 1 for every step of Melt applied. Each individual step that Melt Damage is successfully dealt, increases the penalty to Armor and Shield. Each Cycle that the Melt Affliction remains increases the penalty to Armor and Shield by 1. A successful Resolve reduces the penalty by half (rounded down), and negated if the penalty is at 1.

AFFLICTION VIII: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH BLIND WHEN DEALING LIGHT DAMAGE
When struck by Light Damage every 2 Dice rolled reduces total d12s rolled for their Actions by 1 die for 1 Cycle per die reduced from the Afflicted. The Blind Affliction is resisted by Mental Fortitude Resolve and reduces the cycles remaining by half (minimum 1). Once there are only 1 cycle remaining, a successful resolve negates the effect. 
A Blind character (Natural or otherwise is immune to this effect).

AFFLICTION IX: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH BEFOUL WHEN DEALING DARK DAMAGE
Every 2 points of dark damage dealt will deal prevent one point of healing the Afflicted Character would receive for 1 Cycle plus 1 additional cycle per 4 die rolled. The Befoul Affliction can be resisted by Mental Fortitude Resolve and reduces the remaining cycles by 1, and negates the effect if one cycle remains.

AFFLICTION X: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH SEVER WHEN DEALING SLICE DAMAGE
Every 2 Dice rolled deals an additional point of slice damage per step for 1 cycle plus the number of successful hits with a Slicing Weapon and a Character capable of applying the Sever Affliction. Sever is resisted by Physical Guard Resolve. The Damage is dealt at the end of the cycle and persists if slice damage is dealt and as long as Sever is applied per cycle.

AFFLICTION XI: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH IMPALE WHEN DEALING PENETRATE DAMAGE
 Every 2 Dice rolled ignores up to 1 point of Physical Armor. This bypass is applied before the damage is dealt if the Offense Action or Riposte successfully hits the Target. Penetrate is resisted by a Physical Guard Resolve and negates the Physical Armor bypass.
 
AFFLICTION XII: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH BASH WHEN DEALING IMPACT DAMAGE
Every two successes rolled will reduce combat bonus by one for 1 Cycle per 2 Dice rolled. The Bash Affliction is resisted by Physical Guard Resolve and reduces the cycles remaining by half (minimum 1). Once there there is only 1 cycle remaining, a successful resolve negates the effect.

AFFLICTION XIII: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH TOXIC WHEN DEALING POISON DAMAGE
Every 2 Dice rolled will apply the Toxic Affliction for 1 Cycle and while a Character is Toxic, they will receive one point of Poison damage per 2 Action Points spent while Afflicted. These Action Points need not be spent all at once to receive damage, every instance a Character spends a total of 2 Action Points, they receive the damage instantly. The Toxic Affliction is resisted by Physical Guard Resolve and each step of Toxicity increases the number of cycles by 1. A successful resolve reduces remaining cycles by One: Half if remaining cycles are greater than 1.

AFFLICTION XIV: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH SLOWED WHEN DEALING TEMPORAL DAMAGE
When struck by Temporal damage, every 4 Dice rolled will decrease the targets maximum amount of Action Points by 1 while under the Slowed Affliction. This effect is countered and negated by Mental Fortitude Resolve and every step adds an additional penalty to their total Action Points. This Affliction will last for 1 Cycle per step and each step requires a successful Mental Fortitude resolve.

AFFLICTION XV: AFFLICT A TARGET WITH PAIN WHEN DEALING PSYCHIC DAMAGE
When struck by Psychic damage, every 4 Die rolled will decrease the targets Resolves by 1 while under the Pain Affliction. This effect is countered and negated by an Mental Fortitude Resolve. This Affliction will last for 1 Cycle per step and each time the target fails their resolve, the Affliction will last last an additional cycle.

ELIGIBLE EFFECT VALUE TYPES

WIND (ENERGY): STRONG VERSUS EARTH AND WEAKENED VERSUS FIRE
EARTH (PYSICAL): STRONG VERSUS ELECTRICITY AND WEAKENED VERSUS WIND
ELECTRICITY (ENERGY): STRONG VERSUS WATER AND WEAKENED VERSUS EARTH

ANATOMY: THE KEYWORD ENTRIES DESCRIBED BELOW ALLOW CHANGE AND MODIFICATION TO CHARACTERS AND THEIR FORM, EACH CHANGE OR MODIFICATION COSTS A VARYING AMOUNT OF ACP DEPENDING ON THE KEYWORD ENTRY.
The appearance of a Character is largely determined by Anatomical features that they possess. The Race of each Character is decided by the players as they initially begin to create their Character and any Racial Features that they’d like must be acquired through Abilities using the Anatomy Keyword. Races you find throughout Mythology and created works such as Orcs, and Elves have expected features like green skin and pointed ears. A Strong or Nimble race can be conveyed by increasing Power or Finesse through Passive Boosts. Green Skin or Pointed Ears are cosmetic features that do not require ACP to acquire.

ANATOMY I: INCREASE OR DECREASE WEIGHT OF A VALID TARGET
 Increase or decrease the amount of senses a Character possesses beyond Sight, Smell, Hearing, Taste and Touch by 1 per 6 ACP spent. These additional senses could include such things as Thermal Vision, Scent, Blind-Sense, Electroreception, and Night Vision. Discuss your ideas with your GM about what kind of senses are possible for your character.
 
ANATOMY II: INCREASE THE MODES OF MOVEMENT FOR A CHARACTER BY ONE
Increase or Decrease the modes of movement your Character could possess by 1 per 6 ACP spent. Normal Modes of movement are the ability to Walk, Run, Jump, Climb and Swim. Perhaps you’d like your Character to have the Ability to Fly, Hover, Glide, or Burrow. Discuss your ideas with your GM about what kind of modes of movement are possible for your character.
ANATOMY III: MODIFY THE NUMBER OF LIMBS AVAILABLE TO A CHARACTER
Increase or decrease the number of Limbs your Characters possesses by 1 per 6 ACP spent. The normal amount of Limbs for a humanoid is two arms and two legs for a bipedal creature. However, this Keyword is intended for limbs beyond four, so if your Character is quadrupedal then no ACP need be spent as four limbs is within the limit. Limbs may include additional Arm(s), Leg(s), Wing(s), and Tail(s). Discuss your ideas with your GM about what kind of additional limbs are possible for your character.

ANATOMY IV: MODIFY THE VULNERABILITIES AND  RESISTANCES OF A CHARACTER 
Increase or decrease natural Resistance your Character may have to Physical or Elemental harm by 15 ACP per 50% Resistance up to 100% (Immunity). Elements your Character may be immune to can be Fire (Burn), Water (Freeze), Electricity (Shock), Earth (Crush), Wind (Bluster), and Acid (Melt). IF your Character is Immune to an Element, they have the option of Absorbing that Element if they come in contact with it. They may absorb and heal 1d6 points per 10 ACP Spent once Immunity has been acquired. Total number of Immunities a Character may possess cannot exceed Three. Discuss your ideas with your GM about what kind of immunities are possible for your character.

ANATOMY V: INCREASE OR DECREASE WEIGHT OF A VALID TARGET
A Character can modify the weight of a Character, Object, or Structure that's equal or smaller in size to the user. The user may target another Character, Object or Structure larger than itself, but increases the ACP cost by 2 per Size Rank larger. A targets weight cannot be reduced to zero, but it can be reduced to weightless. A Character with modified weight, increases or decreases Speed Rank by 1 per 100 lbs., when the targets weight is increased above their standard wieght, or decreased below their standard weight.

ANATOMY VI: INCREASE OR DECREASE THE WEIGHT OF A VALID TARGET BY 50%
Modify the weight of a Character, Object, or Structure by 50% per 1 ACP spent with each subsequent application increasing or decreasing weight additively. As an example, if 4 ACP is spent, the increase or decrease is 200% or x3 to the weight of a character, object or structure. This percentage increase is applied after the Anatomy V keyword is applied to a character, object or structure, and not before. If an Object weighs 2 lbs, and its weight is increased by 8 lbs, the weight is now 10 lbs. and is increase is increased further by 200% (3.0x) setting the weight to 30 lbs.

ANATOMY VII: INCREASE OR DECREASE THE LENGTH OF A VALID TARGET
A Character can modify the length of a Character, Object, or Structure that's equal or smaller in size to the user. The user may target another Character, Object or Structure larger than itself, but increases the ACP cost by 2 per Size Rank larger. As the length becomes smaller than 1 ft., the cost remains but per inch instead. A targets length cannot be reduced to a length smaller than 1 inch.

ANATOMY VIII: INCREASE OR DECREASE THE HEIGHT OF A VALID TARGET
A Character can modify the height of a Character, Object, or Structure that's equal or smaller in size to the user. The user may target another Character, Object or Structure larger than itself, but increases the ACP cost by 2 per Size Rank larger. As the height becomes smaller than 1 ft., the cost remains but per inch instead. A targets height cannot be reduced to a height smaller than 1 inch.

ANATOMY IX: INCREASE OR DECREASE THE WIDTH OF A VALID TARGET
A Character can modify the width of a Character, Object, or Structure that's equal or smaller in size to the user. The user may target another Character, Object or Structure larger than itself, but increases the ACP cost by 2 per Size Rank larger. As the width becomes smaller than 1 ft., the cost remains but per inch instead. A targets width cannot be reduced to a width smaller than 1 inch.

An intact structure can be made a valid target for modifying it's weight, height, width and length, under three condititions. The Ability has a range large enough to emcompass the structure as a whole, the size of the structure is shrunk to match the size of the user, or the user's size is increased to match the size of the structure. Destroyed structures with debris are an invalid target, but the debris are objects which are valid targets using Anatomy II keywords. Reducing the size of an object does not decrease its weight, nor does decreasing weight apply any changes to its size. If a 300 lb object has its size reduced down to tiny, it's still a 300 lb object.

ALLY: The Ally Keyword allows a Character to Summon, Hire, or otherwise Employ the strength of others to aid them in any way that they need help. The Ally Keyword is a peculiar Keyword as some Characters may rely solely on their Familiars, Guardians, and or whatever the Ally Keyword is being used for. While others may use these Allies as a Support Function to further strengthen the Characters favored qualities. Allies are not required to be permanent addition to the Party and may function as an instantaneous Ability where the Ally shows up, takes 1 Action and disappears. A Character may only have 1 Ally plus 1 additional Primary Ally for every Two Character Levels (Two at Level 1) and Allies of Allies can only have 1 Ally per 3 Levels of the Ally that controls them.

The Ally Keyword only has 1 variation (Unlike other Keywords) and the use of the Ally Keyword and Allies are separate Non-Player Characters under the control of the Character that's using it and thus solely under the Player's control. As Allies are independent NPCs to the Character, any resources the NPC uses is independent to the Character that controls it.

The amount of ACP available to an Ally, is much like a Character, except the base amount is 5 points plus 2 per Ally Level as opposed to a Character which receives 5 plus 5 per level. Allies receive 3 Ability Slots plus 1 per Two Character Levels from the Character that controls them. As a base, all Allies receive 3d4 to their Stat points and permanent Allies receives a 1 Stat point for every 10 Points invested in the Ally Keyword and 1 Stat point per 15 points invested for Allies with a Duration. Each Ally has a separate investment which requires their own locked in Ability Slots. If Character A has two Allies which both have Double Ability Slots locked in, then Character A has used 4 Ability Slots with two Allies that are independent from each other with their own stats, equipment and Abilities.

Much like a Character, an Ally has stats that they can increase based on the Characters investment into the Ability Slot(s) designated to each Ally independently. Ally stats cannot exceed 6 at 1st level, and the max increases by 1 per 3 levels. Like a Character, 4 Points in Power allows that Ally +4 Bonus to Melee and so on. However you decide to build your build your Allies is entirely up to you, discuss with your GM about how to convey the kind of Allies you're looking to create.

Allies and their Abilities have access to all Keywords available to Players and their Characters. Allies may have access to their own Allies, but follow the same rules. So if an Ally (Under the Character's Control) invests 60 ACP, then that secondary Ally will have 6 points in which to distribute throughout their stats. However, an Ally of an Ally will only receive 1 ABS per 2 ABS the Primary Ally has. This process remains as Allies of Allies increases.

The Level of an Ally is dependent on the Character that Controls them, Primary Allies are the same level of the Character controlling them (Minimum 1) but are considered half the level of the Character for controlling Allies, and Allies of Allies are half the level of the Ally that controls them (Minimum 1). So a level 10 Character would have level 10 Primary Allies, and Allies of Allies would be level 5 and then Level 2 and so on. Allies of all Tiers do not receive Level Advancement bonus rolls to stats or additional Ability Slots in the same way as Characters. At Max a level 10 Character could potentially have 6 Primary Allies, 12 Secondary Allies, and 12 Tertiary Allies and so on.


The Death of an Ally is not the loss of an Ability Slot, depending on what kind of Allies they are, such as nameless Mercenaries, Elementals or Zombies. They are resummoned, recruited or recreated after a Long rest and will appear among your Allies once the rest has ended. If your Primary Allies are named and unique, discuss with your GM how to fairly compensate the loss to the Character. Which could mean an ABS Refund or perhaps means of resurrection to restore the Primary Ally. 

Unique Primary Allies receive an additional 3d4 to their 
Stat points, distributed as the Player chooses.

ALTER: Altering the features of Abilities, Actions, Equipment and even features the Character possesses can be done through the Alter Keyword. This kind of Keyword adds versatility and improvisation to a Character that may otherwise be rigid and linear. As needed, a Character may alter the function of a weapon they are wielding from a Shotgun to a Hammer. Perhaps they have come across several enemies that are immune to Electricity and can change the damage they would normally deal from Electricity to Fire. Or the Breath of Frost that is normally a 30 ft. (16 Squares) Cone, could turn into an 80 ft. (16 Squares) line of freezing energy.

ALTER I: ADD OR MODIFY THE SHAPE OF AN ACTION OR ABILITY EQUAL TO RANGE
Alter I allows a Character to modify the Shape of an Action or Ability equal to the total Squares in it's Range or Area of a Effect. 6 ACP per Shape the Character would like available to the Action or Ability.

ALTER II: ADD OR MODIFY AN EXISTING EFFECT VALUE TYPE
Alter II allows a Character to change, add, and or modify the Effect Value Type (Damage, Heal, or Shield). 
This Modification can be applied to Actions, Abilities, and Equipment.

ALTER III: ADD OR MODIFY THE EFFECT VALUE SUB-TYPE
Alter III allows a Character to change, add, and or modify the Effect Value Sub-Type (Physical or Energy). Physical; Slice, Impact, and Penetrate. Energy; Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, and Electricity.

ALTER IV: ADD OR MODIFY AN EXISTING ASPECT ON AN ACTION OR ABILITY
Alter IV allows a Character to change, add, and or modify the Aspect (Negative, Neutral, and or Positive) of the Action or Ability. Discuss with your GM if this is an applicable choice for your Setting.

ALTER V: ADD OR MODIFY THE DEVICE TYPE FOR ITEMS AND EQUIPMENT
Alter V allows a Character to change, add, and or modify the Device Type (Weapon, Armor, and or Shield) for an Action or Ability. Refer to Equipment Creation when choosing additional forms for your Devices. Cost 4 ACP per Alteration.

ALTER VI: ADD OR MODIFY THE DEVICE SUB-TYPE FOR ITEMS AND EQUIPMENT
Alter VI allows a Character to change, add, and or modify the Device Sub-Type. May include; Axe, Bow, Catalyst, Crossbow, Dagger, Firearm, Gauntlet, Hammer, Pole-Arm, Sling, Spear, Staff, Sword, Thrown, and Whip.

BOOST: As a Character Advances in Levels, Boosts will become much more commonly used, as they become more available for use. Boosts, just as Empower or Accuracy is one of the three most important Keywords among all Keywords as it can increase or decrease every Stat available to the Character.

However, Secondary Stats such as HP, AP, React, Damage Reduction, Energy Resistance, and Core Actions may all be increased or decreased by temporary or permanent boons. Boosts that increase Stamina, Focus, and or Mana cannot be increased with the same Resource it costs. So, a Character may increase another’s or their own Stamina by 2 for 1 Mana, but never 2 Mana for 1 Mana. This allows efficiency for Characters but not infinite resource.

BOOST I: INCREASE A PRIMARY STAT BY 1 POINT (ALWAYS PASSIVE), COST 30 ACP PER POINT
BOOST II: INCREASE HEALTH POINTS BY 1 POINT (ALWAYS PASSIVE), COST 4 ACP PER POINT
BOOST III: APPLY 1 POINT OF SHIELD TO A RESOURCE (HP, AP, SP, FP, AND MP), COST 2 ACP PER POINT
BOOST IV: INCREASE, DECREASE, RESTORE OR DESTROY AP BY 1 POINT, COST 10 ACP PER POINT
BOOST V: INCREASE MAXIMUM STAMINA, FOCUS OR MANA BY 1 POINT, COST 10 ACP PER POINT
BOOST VI: INCREASE PHYSICAL GUARD, MENTAL FORTITUDE, OR ENERGY RESISTANCE BY 1, COST 15 ACP PER POINT
BOOST VII: INCREASE SPEED RANK BY 1 RANK, COST 8 ACP PER POINT
BOOST VIII: INCREASE AVAILABLE SKILL RANK BY 1 RANK (ALWAYS PASSIVE), COST 20 ACP PER POINT
BOOST IX: INCREASE ARMOR VERSUS SPECIFIC DAMAGE TYPE BY 1 POINT, COST 8 ACP PER POINT
BOOST X: INCREASE STRIKE TARGET BY 1 POINT, COST 12 ACP PER POINT
BOOST XI: INCREASE BONUS TO LEGERITY BY 1 POINT, COST 15 ACP PER POINT
BOOST XII: INCREASE AVAILABLE STRENGTH BY 1 POINT, COST 5 ACP PER POINT

Hinder is the exact opposite of Boost, as it decreases the stats based on Keywords chosen. These kinds of abilities are typically used towards other Targets and are intended to debilitate. However, as Increasing or Decreasing a Primary Sub-Stat can only be Passive, it is not possible to reduce the Primary Sub-Stats of others. But all other stats are viable targets for reduction, and it can be very effective when successful. Such as reducing the Action Points of a Target while they are already negative. Or reducing the Speed Rank of a Target that relies on Stride and fast movements.

CHARGE: The Charge Keyword allows Characters to expend additional resources in order to increase the Potency of an Action or Ability. In doing so will add bonus die to the Total rolled Dice regardless if it’s for Damage, Healing or Shielding. This Keyword can give a Character with expendable resources, or perhaps a Character with reckless abandon to really push the limits of what they are capable of or what is expected of them. Any increase to the Dice of the Action or Ability adds Die of the same type.

Any Character that is shocked (Receives Damage equal to 50% of total HP) while Charging automatically loses any further charges and must discharge the Ability immediately. If they failed the Resolve to resist the Shock, the target any eligible targets within Range at random regardless if they are an Ally, Enemy or Object.

CHARGE I: INCREASE THE EFFECT VALUE BY ONE DIE PER CYCLE SPENT
Increase the Dice of an Action or Ability by 1 Die per 20 ACP per Cycle up to 3 Cycles in Total. As an example, if a Character invested 60 ACP into Charge I and spent 2 Cycles Charging their Ability then they will add 6 Die to the total of rolled Dice. Charging by Cycle requires the Character Charges their ability for an entire Cycle, meaning they cannot discharge it until the start of the next turn, if they choose to.

CHARGE II: INCREASE THE EFFECT VALUE BY ONE DIE PER 3 ACTIONS SPENT
Increase the Dice of an Action or Ability by 1 Die per 20 ACP spent per 3 AP (Up to 6 AP Spent) spent in addition to the AP Required to use the Action or Ability. As an example, if a Character invested 40 ACP into Charge II and uses a Heavy Strike for 3 AP, and then spends an additional 6 AP then they will add 7 Die to the Heavy Strike at the cost of 9 Action Points. A steep cost for great power. However, any Character may not spend more than their Total Actions Points when using Charge II.

CHARGE III: INCREASE THE EFFECT VALUE BY ONE DIE PER RESOURCE SPENT
Increase the Dice of an Action or Ability by 1 Die per 20 ACP spent per Resource spent up to 3 Stamina, Focus or Mana. As an example, if a Character invested 40 ACP into Charge III and decided to spend an additional 3 Stamina on their Action or Ability then they will increase total Dice by 6 Die.

CHARGE IV: INCREASE THE EFFECT VALUE BY ONE DIE THROUGH BACKLASH
Increase the Dice of an Action or Ability by 1 Die per 10 ACP and receives damage to their HP in the form of Backlash equal half of the Bonus Dice added to the Action or Ability. As an example, if a Character invested 60 ACP into Charge IV to increase the total Dice by 6d10, then they will also take 6d10 Backlash Damage divided by half to their HP. So that Character can roll a potential 6 to 60 with 6d10 (Exploding dice not included) and divides the result in half. 
(Note: Rolling maximum on a die does not add an additional die when rolling for Backlash. Additionally, Backlash is no affected by Armor, Shielding, Damage Reduction, Energy Resistance and is not reduced by Block, Dodge or Parry. But it can be healed once it has been taken and resolved.)

COGNITION: The Cognition Keyword grants Characters that acquire it the ability to manipulate the process of knowledge, perception, intuition, and reasoning in the minds of themselves and others. This allows them to manipulate the perceived environments of their targets and create illusions and intangible illusions. Cognition Keywords cannot be used as Passive Ability Slots. All Cognition Actions costs a minimum of 2 Actions Points to perform and 1 Resource per Ability Slot (Up to Two).

COGNITION I: MANIPULATE HOW THE TARGET CHARACTER SPENDS ACTION POINTS
Decide what Action or Actions a targeted Character declares and performs based on the amount of Action Points you may manipulate. Each Action Point the Targeted Character must use costs 15 ACP each and allows for an Intelligence Resolve vs. Legerity for each Action to be performed. Cognition I cannot be a Passive Ability Slot, and costs 2 Action Points to perform. Cognition I does not have a base Range beyond 5 ft. and without any additional Range added via the Range Keyword starts within arm’s reach of the Character. Any Action that would put the Targeted Character in harms way immediately allows for an additional Intelligence Resolve to avoid it. If the Targeted Character once again fails their Resolve then the Action is carried out regardless of the consequences.

As an example, if Character A has a Double Ability Slot invested in Cognition I at a total of 60 ACP with a base ranged of 75 ft., then they may target another Character within 75 ft. and may manipulate 4 Action Points if Character B fails their Intelligent Resolve. Character B fails their Resolve, and Character A determines they will use 3 of their Action Points to Sprint (Speed Rank +2) in the opposite direction of Character A. Character B does this and runs away, though the Cognition I effect ends as soon as the desired action occurs. If Character B succeeds in their resolve, then the effect is negated, and Character A has wasted 2 Action Points and 2 Resource.

COGNITION II: CHANGE HOW A TARGET CHARACTER PERCEIVES YOU OR ANOTHER
Manipulate the senses of another Target Character by deceiving their surrounding perception and creating illusions and hallucinations. You may temporarily change the appearance of yourself or other Characters according to the perception of the affected Target Character. Each Trait that you change about the Character (yourself or others) costs 10 ACP and if the Target fails their Intelligence Resolve. Cognition II does not have a base Range beyond 5 ft. and without any additional Range added via the Range Keyword starts within arm’s reach of the Character as well as a base duration of 1 Cycle (Additional Cycles will need to be acquired via the Duration Keyword). Traits available to be changed are as follows: Height, Weight, Age, Gender, Facial Features, Hair Color & Style, Skin Color, Smell, Physical Features, Clothing, Armor, Weapons, and Equipment.

COGNITION III: MANIPULATE A TARGETS MIND TO CREATE ILLUSIONARY COPIESManipulate the senses of another Target Character by deceiving their surrounding perception and creating illusions and hallucinations. At the cost of 24 ACP You may temporarily create an illusionary copy of yourself or others at a base of 1 Cycle and as Cognition III does not have a base Range beyond 5 ft. and without any additional Range added via the Range Keyword starts adjacent to your location. Cognition III has a base duration of 1 Cycle (Additional Cycles will need to be acquired via the Duration Keyword). 

Any Character unaware of the illusion must roll an Acuity Resolve vs. Legerity to become aware but this resolve does not provide the source of the illusion. Only that that it is an illusion. Illusions have no stats of any kind and are completely intangible. If another Character fails their resolve, they feel as if the illusion is both real and tangible. If the Illusion comes in contact with another Character who believes it is real, then they are immediately granted another Acuity Resolve vs. Legerity. Other Characters who are truly aware of the illusion, if trusted or influenced, may reveal the target to be an illusion and immediately grants an additional Acuity Resolve to those it communicated this to. Successful Acuity Resolves does not grant immunity to any additional illusions created thereafter.

COGNITION IV: MANIPULATE A TARGET'S MIND TO CREATE ILLUSIONARY SURROUNDING
Manipulate the senses of another Target Character by deceiving their surrounding perception and creating illusions and hallucinations. At the cost of 24 ACP you may temporarily alter the appearance and render yourself or other Characters invisible.  Other Characters may roll an Acuity Resolve to detect the presence of invisible Characters through means such as Sound, Smell, Taste, and Touch (including additional senses Characters may have acquired). Cognition IV does not have a base Range beyond 5 ft. and without any additional Range added via the Range Keyword starts within arm’s reach of the Character as well as a base duration of 1 Cycle (Additional Cycles will need to be acquired via the Duration Keyword). Additionally, Cognition IV may also be used to render senses such as Sound, Smell, Taste, and Touch “invisible”. Such as producing zero sound when you walk, hiding your scent, appearing tasteless, and seeming intangible (Costs 12 ACP).

COGNITION V: MANIPULATE A TARGET'S MIND TO REVEAL THEIR ACTION CARDS
Manipulate the senses of another Target Character by deceiving their surrounding perception and creating illusions and hallucinations. At the cost of 24 ACP, you pierce the mind of another revealing their intention. The targeted Character reveals one of their face-down cards from their set of Action Cards to the Character (Player controlled) which pierced their mind using Cognition V. The Targeted Character may counteract the effect by either an Intelligence Resolve vs. Legerity, or by using Ruse to keep their Action Cards hidden. Additionally, Cognition V may be used to reveal this intention to other Characters within Range. However, Cognition V does not have a base Range beyond 5 ft. and without any additional Range added via the Range Keyword starts within arm’s reach.

When thinking in terms of a Character being in "harms way", it's best considered any instance that would lead to a loss of Resources such as Health Points, Action Point, Stamina, Focus, and Mana. The loss of resources does not need to be dealt in order to qualify an instances as harmful. The Resolves the Character is allowed is before any harm would come to them, if they fail the resolve then they fail to avoid the loss to their resources. This is not an subjective rule, if an Action they are told to do would result in a loss of resources, they are allowed a Resolve.

When a Player can use a created Ability that revolves around Cognition V can be a little tricky and hard to understand. If you use it as an Active Action, then you are no longer left with an Active Action in your Cycle and left with only a Reaction. If Cognition V is used as a Triggering Ability, then a Player could use Cognition V as a Reaction and then respond with an Active Action such as Strike, Volley, Grab, Collide, Block, Dodge or Parry. 

CREATION: The Creation Keyword allows a Character to conjure, produce and create a large variety of raw or refined materials, objects, items and equipment. From Iron Ore to quasi-corporeal weaponry, the Creation Keyword is a very open ended and creative Keyword that should be thoroughly discussed when used in an Action or Ability. Anything created, conjured or provided by the Creation Keyword is not permanent, but at minimum will last exactly 1 Cycle, unless paired with the Duration Keyword. The cost of ACP may be doubled to produce permanent materials, objects, items and equipment. Drawback option: Creation keyword that only affect specific material types grants an ACP refund of 10 ACP.

CREATION I: CONJURE OR PRODUCE RAW MATERIALS IN VARYING QUANTITIES
Produce 4lbs of Raw Materials per 1 ACP Spent (2 ACP for permanent materials). Raw Materials could include materials such as dirt, branches, sand, and mineral ore. Discuss with your GM about what kind of materials to produce and what you are trying to convey by using this Keyword. (Not required to be solid or physical)

CREATION II: CONJURE OR PRODUCE REFINED MATERIALS IN VARYING QUANTITIES
Produce 2lb of Refined Materials per 1 ACP Spent (4 ACP for  permanent materials). Refined Materials could include materials such as wooden planks, metal ingots, and glass. Discuss with your GM about what kind of materials to produce and what you are trying to convey by using this Keyword.

CREATION III: CONJURE OR PRODUCE A DEVICE VARYING IN TYPES AND QUANTITY
Produce a temporary device worth an 3 ECP per 1 ACP invested in Creation III. Producing a temporary or permanent device is worth the equivalent ECP, and temporary devices require at least 1 cycle in order to be used and any device created is not automatically equipped, or stowed. But upon creation, a Character must have an available action to either Equip, or stow the device or it will automatically drop to the ground in front of them. Any device produced is of common rarity and requires Creation IV in order to produce devices beyond common.

CREATION IV: INCREASE THE RARITY RANK OF A DEVICE BASED CURRENT QUALITY (CREATION IV IS ALWAYS PASSIVE)
Increase the Rarity Rank of an existing Device (Temporary or Permanent) by 1 per 20 ACP Spent. Increasing the Rarity of a Device increases the overall effectiveness by increasing relevant stats. Each Rank of Rarity increases available ECP by 10 up to 50. Common (10), Uncommon (20), Rare (30), Epic (40), and Legendary (50). Each Rarity Rank bonus to ECP is multiplied by Item Level. The Item Level of an Item or Equipment is equal to the Character that Crafted it. Increasing Rarity requires 3 days of crafting per rank of Rarity per Item Level. As an example, upgrading a level 6 common item to a Level 6 epic Item would require 18 Days of work. Additional ACP cost of 5 per Device Type. Amount of work required = 3 days x Rarity x item level

COMMON: 60 ECP PLUS 20 ECP PER ITEM LEVEL
UNCOMMON: 60 ECP PLUS 40 ECP PER ITEM LEVEL
RARE: 60 ECP PLUS 60 ECP PER ITEM LEVEL
EPIC: 60 ECP PLUS 80 ECP PER ITEM LEVEL
LEGENDARY: 60 ECP PLUS 100 ECP PER ITEM LEVEL

EMPOWER & PRECISION: When it comes to increasing the potency of an Action, nothing is more important than the Effect Value of an Action or Ability. Even if it’s a Precise Action or Ability, if the Effect Value is negligible, then the precision will feel meaningless (Vice versa). As Such, the Empower Keyword focuses on increasing the Effect Value of an Action or Ability in a variety of ways.

EMPOWER I: Increase or Decrease the number of Dice with an Action (Active or Trigger only). 3 ACP PER SIDE
EMPOWER II: Increase or Decrease the bonus of an Action by one point. 5 ACP PER POINT
EMPOWER III: Increase the result by one per Die rolled with an Action. 10 ACP PER POINT
EMPOWER IV: Increase the Effect Value of an Effect, Action or Ability equal to any Sub-Stat. 20 ACP PER STAT

Costs 20 ACP per Stat added up to One additional Sub-Stat. Including the PWR, FNE or ADR. As an example, you could add PWR & VIT to a Melee Strike Action which normally adds PWR as a Bonus. Similar to Empower III, Empower IV could allow a Flat Value equal both Sub-Stats for a very potent Ability or Action. Cannot choose a Sub-Stat that already applies.

PRECISION I: Increase or Decrease Accuracy Die for an Action or Ability. 3 ACP PER SIDE
PRECISION II: Increase or Decrease the bonus to Accuracy by 1. 5 ACP PER SIDE
PRECISION III: Choose a Die and roll it an additional time and choose which die to keep. 10 ACP PER SIDE

Actions and Abilities can be used to damage Action Points instead of Health Points as to take down a target by rendering them unconscious. If chosen to allow the Action or Ability to damage Action Points, the cost is increased by 2 per side of the die. Additionally, Unarmed Combat can also be used to target Action Points or Health Points with non-lethal damage which cannot take a Character beyond 0 Health Points, but its can reduce Action Points into the negatives. Additionally, if dealt after a Character is already at 0 Health Points, the non-lethal damage will convert into Lethal damage regardless of the intent of the attacker.

Each additional Die added beyond the 1st costs an additional 1 ACP per side of the die. As an example, to add 1d10 would initially costs 30 ACP, and the second d10 would costs 40 ACP and 40 ACP for each d10 added to the total number of die available for that Action or Ability. This increase applies to Items and Equipment as well.

DURATION: The Duration Keyword is a representation of time and deals directly with Cycles, and Action Points. As two Action Points is the equivalent of 1 second of time. Cycles themselves do not have a definitive number of seconds that they represent. But the amount of AP spent in a Cycle can equate to the amount of time that Character has spent in their Cycle.  

While not all Abilities will have a Duration, any temporary Boosts or Hinderances will automatically have a Duration of 1 Cycle at minimum, and many Abilities that have an effect that changes a stat will benefit greatly from an extended Duration. However, the Duration Keyword doesn’t only apply to how long an Ability is an effect, but also affects Over-Time Abilities such as Bleeds or Poisons.

DURATION I: INCREASE THE DURATION OF AN ABILITY BY ONE CYCLE, COST 2 ACP PER CYCLE
DURATION II: RESOLVE AN ACTION OR ABILITY AT MAXIMUM EFFECT VALUE, COST 4 ACP PER CYCLE
Resolve an Effect Value (Damage, Heal, or Shield) by maximizing and dividing the Total over the number of Cycles added to the Action or Ability (Minimum 3 Cycles). As an example, if Character A used a Poisoned Blade to Strike Character B, and if Character B fails their Vitality Resolve, then Character A will deal 3d6+9(27 Damage) over 3 Cycles. Meaning Character B will suffer 9 damage per Cycle for 3 Cycles. Each time Character A successfully poisons Character B, 27 Damage will be added to the remaining Duration. If Character A successfully poisons Character B, then that 9 damage turns into 18, 27, 36 and so on. This keyword has an initial cost of 12 ACP.

DURATION III: RESTORE HEALTH POINTS BY ONE POINT PER CYCLE, COSTS 8 ACP PER CYCLE
DURATION IV: RESTORE ACTION POINTS BY ONE POINT PER CYCLE, COSTS 10 ACP PER CYCLE
DURATION V: RESTORE STAMINA, FOCUS AND OR MANA BY ONE POINT PER CYCLE, COSTS 12 ACP PER CYCLE

Duration III, Duration IV, and Duration V are Keywords that provide regenerative properties to a Character. They occur whether a Character is conscious or unconscious, but the Character must be alive for the Ability to take effect. However, like any Keyword available, Duration can have a hindering effect. Meaning that these Keywords can be used with Abilities to create a degenerative effect on a target, reducing that resource by a certain amount per cycle.

As an example, if Character A invested 72 ACP into Duration III to create an Ability that reduces HP by 10 per Cycle for 6 cycles, then if Character B were affected they would lose 10 HP per cycle for a total of 60 HP. Since the original wording is Restore, then losing HP would not affect their maximum HP but instead destroys it as if taking damage. 

Duration is closely tied to Cycles, and the start of a Players turn with their Character(s) begins with the start of a Cycle. Any Ability which is a persistent effect such as Afflictions all have a minimum of 1 Cycle to their effect and Boosts and Hinderances start with 1 Cycle for the Duration for free. Their duration must be increased using the Keyword Duration I in order for these effects to last longer.

KINESIS: The Kinesis Keyword is primarily used by Characters who wish to push, pull, lift or otherwise move Characters, and Objects they can perceive through their available senses. Kinesis can also be used to manipulate energy and the Characters surrounding environment. Kinesis can be described in different forms such as Telekinesis, Psychokinesis, Pyrokinesis and so on. It is entirely dependent on the concept, flavor and design of your Character that will determine how Kinesis is used. Kinesis is also dependent on other Keywords to function, Keywords such as Range and Duration.

Characters are not required to consume Energy Substances when using Kinesis II. If Character A has invested 60 ACP into Kinesis II, then the maximum amount of 1d10 he can add to the Action is 6d10 but requires 6 occupied squares of the relevant Energy Substance. Kinesis I may have a similar effect, but the Effect Value is determined by weight and momentum, which is 1d10 per 100 lbs. So, if Character A is near a source of Water, and wishes to drop 600 lbs. worth of water on a Target, they will need at least 6 squares occupied by water to complete the desired Action. 

KINESIS I: MANIPULATE (PUSH, PULL, & LIFT) 6 LBS. PER 1 POINT OF ACP INVESTED
Kinesis I allows a Character to push, pull, lift and fully manipulator the direction of any eligible target such as another Character, Object or Structure. Similar to Strength, Kinesis I has a limit on how much weight can be manipulated based on the investment in Kinesis I. Without accompanying keywords such as Range, and Duration, Kinesis would be limited to a close range action requiring the Character to touch it's target. Additionally, the distance a Target is manipulated and its total weight can determine its Speed Rank and damage done if collided with another Character, Structure or Object. Every four squares traveled adds 1d12 impact damage and 1d12 impact damage for every 100 lbs. the target weighs. The ACP cost for the Range Keywords is doubled for both number of targets and Shape. Limiting what Kinesis can target to what type increases available ACP for the Ability Slots by 50%. (Such as targetting only Metal or Water)

When used against the will of other Characters, to resist the effects of Kinesis I the Opposing Character must roll Power Resolve vs. Legerity or be manipulated as you choose for one Action. If the Character B fails their Resolve versus the Kinesis Action, then Character A may push, pull, and or lift Character B up to the maximum range they invested in their Ability. Characters, Objects and Environments automatically succeed their Resolve if their weight exceeds the ACP investment into Kinesis. Much like Kinesis I, Kinesis II allows a Character to freely manipulate weightless Energy Substances such as Light, fire, Wind and perhaps more metaphysical concepts such as Gravity or Magnetism. Kinesis II functions through occupied Squares and level of presence.

KINESIS II:MANIPULATE SOURCES OF ENERGY WITHIN RANGE PER SQUARE
Increase Effect Value  by 1d12 for every Squares occupied by relevant Energy Substances at the cost of 1 AP per 1d12 available. Chosen occupied squares are consumed once used and can only be used once per Action. Squares must be within Range and this Keyword is restricted by the Burst Shape for Range IV. Energy Substances that may be constantly present, such as Wind or Gravity, are consumed as well and do not return for until the start of this Characters next cycle. So, if Character A consumes the Air within a 5 Ft. Burst around them, no air will be available to breathe until the start of their next turn. ACP Cost reduced by 50% if only a certain source can be manipulated using Kinesis.

RANGE: All Actions and Abilities rely on Range to sculpt how they behave during gameplay. Each Square is considered 5 ft. of range and anything within 5 ft. or less is considered Close-Quarters or Melee. Abilities and Actions can have a large variety of shapes when it comes to Area of Effects such as a Cone, Line, Cylinder, Burst, and Cube. These shapes are important to establish when creating Abilities, so the Players know who and what their Abilities affect when successful.

Additionally, all Actions and Abilities that have an Area of Effect also have a Point of Origin, determined by the Player, when the Abilities are created. A Point of Oirigin determines where the Area of Effect starts and requires Range I if the Origin is seperate from the Character.

RANGE I: INCREASE THE RANGE OF AN ACTION OR ABILITY BY 1 SQUARE, COST 1 ACP PER SQUARE
RANGE II: A LINE OF EFFECT AFFECTS ALL TARGETS PER SQUARE ADDED TO RANGE, COST 2 ACP PER SQUARE
RANGE III: A CONE WILL AFFECT ALL TARGETS WITHIN THE AREA (3 SQUARES), COST 2 ACP PER SQUARE
A Cone will start out at 3 Squares (6 ACP) , increasing by 2 ACP per Square beyond the inital three Squares required to be considered a Cone. Every additional row of Squares each costs 2 ACP as normal. As an example, a row of 5 Squares would cost 10 ACP to add on to the existing three squares bringing the total Area of Effect for a Cone of that size to 16 ACP.

RANGE IV: A CUBE AFFECTS ALL TARGETS WITHIN ITS AREA OF EFFECT, COST 2 ACP PER SQUARE
A Cubic Area of Effect works a differently from a Line or a Cone as it can also affect all targets within in Area of Effect beyond a horizontal plane, but also includes targets beneath and above the Point of Origin. However, the biggest difference is how ACP cost is determined when choosing to use a Cubic Area of Effect.  A Cube starts off with 1 Square = 2 ACP (5 ft. Cube), to 8 Squares = 16 ACP (10 ft. Cube), 27 Squares = 54 ACP (15 ft. Cube) and 64 Squares = 128 ACP (20 ft. Cube). Cylinder, like a Cube, has its cost affected by Height but not width. And it’s cost will only be increased by each square in its height.

RANGE V: A BURST AFFECTS ALL TARGETS WITHIN ITS AREA OF EFFECT, COST 2 ACP PER SQUARE
A Burst will start out at 8 Squares (16 ACP), and it’s cost for the next Tier can be calculated by rows similar to a Cone. A Burst around a single square such as a Character or an Object will start off with 3 Rows of 3 Squares (9 Total). Adding both Rows and Columns will be dependent on the previous Tier. To count the Inner burst, you exclude the center leaving you with 8 Squares. [2] + 2 + 2 + 2 (8 Squares). Each tier adds to 2 plus the previous Tier then multiplying it by 4. So, the next tier would cost 32 ACP (4 x 4 = 16 Squares) and the Tier after that would cost 48 ACP (6 x 6 = 24 Squares).

REINFORCE: The Reinforce Keyword allows a Character to add additional Sub-Stats to their Resources as well as their Strike Target. This can strengthen a Character and covers weaknesses they may have due to low Sub-stats in critical locations. As an example, HP starts with Five Sub-Stats and is allowed Two additional Stats to add to it (Seven Total).

REINFORCE I: INCREASE HP BY THE VALUE OF ANOTHER SUB-STAT, COSTS 10 ACP PER STAT
Reinforcing Health Points can be allowed with up to two additional Sub-Stats and 
with Stats that are not already being used to increase Health Points.

REINFORCE II: INCREASE AP BY THE VALUE OF ANOTHER SUB-STAT, COSTS 10 ACP PER STAT
Reinforcing Action Points can be allowed with up to two additional Sub-Stats and 
with Stats that are not already being used to increase Action Points.

REINFORCE III: INCREASE SP, FP, OR MP BY HALF THE VALUE OF ANOTHER SUB-STAT, COSTS 10 ACP PER STAT
Reinforcing Resource Points can up allowed with up to two additional Sub-Stats and 
with Stats that are not already being used to increase Resource Points.

REINFORCE IV: INCREASE REACT BY HALF THE VALUE OF ANOTHER SUB-STAT, COSTS 10 ACP PER STAT
Reinforcing Reaction can be allowed with up to two additional Sub-Stats and 
with Stats that are not already being used to increase Reaction.

REINFORCE V: INCREASE PG, MF, OR ER BY HALF THE VALUE OF ANOTHER SUB-STAT, COSTS 10 ACP PER STAT
Reinforcing Damage Reduction or Energy Resistance can be allowed with up to two additional Sub-Stats and with Stats that are not already being used to increase DR or ER.

REINFORCE VI: INCREASE STRIKE TARGET BY HALF THE VALUE OF ANOTHER SUB-STAT, COSTS 10 ACP PER STAT
Reinforcing Strike Target can be allowed with up to two additional Sub-Stats and with Stats that are not already being used to increase Strike Target.

REINFORCE VII: INCREASE EFFECT VALUE BY HALF THE VALUE OF ANOTHER SUB-STAT, COSTS 10 ACP PER STAT
Reinforcing Effect Value can be allowed with up to two additional Sub-Stats and with Stats that are not already being used to increase the Effect Value. Reinforcement can be applied to EV types.

REINFORCE VIII: INCREASE EFFECT VALUE DIE BY A CHOSEN DEVICE (HELD & FUNCTIONING), COSTS 10 ACP PER STAT
Reinforce an Active Action by applying a held or wielded device equal to the Effect Value of the device such as a Weapon, Shield or Tool. The Device must be functioning, and will apply the Effect Value you of the Device.

TRAVEL: The Travel Keyword represents a Characters ability to move themselves, another character or object from one location to another. The Travel Keyword can be different from Stride and Speed Rank as the Travel Keyword can also be depicted as appearing and reappearing in an instant (Depending on how the abilities are constructed).

The Travel keyword, like other keywords, is dependent on Keywords like Range, and Duration. As how these Characters or Objects travel, is how the ability is both constructed and described. Affecting Characters and Objects using the Travel Keyword, specifically for transporting, is dependent only on distance, quantity, and Size Rank. ACP Investment is required for Larger Characters and Objects as they occupy more than one Square at a time.

TRAVEL I: GRANT ADDITIONAL SQUARES OF MOVEMENT, COSTS 3 ACP PER SQUARE
At the cost of 4 ACP per Square, a Character can add One Square of movement to an Action or an Ability during any point allocated as they choose during the Action or Ability. The additional movement can be used before, after or split between. This additional movement does not require a Stride Action and does not increase Strike Target or Speed Rank.

TRAVEL II: RELOCATE A CHARACTER FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER, COSTS 12 ACP PER SQUARE
Using the Travel II Keyword, a Character can choose to change the location of a Character from one Square to a different Square. These Locations can be adjacent, but they cannot occupy the same Square. This Keyword does not inherently have a distance that these Characters can be moved, so it still requires ACP Investment in the Range Keyword. A Character moving from one Square to another does build momentum nor cause Collision unless the Character was already in motion such as a Stride Action, falling, or if they were being forcibly moved.

TRAVEL III: RELOCATE AN OBJECT FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER, COSTS 6 ACP PER SQUARE
Using the Travel III Keyword, a Character can choose to change the location of an Object from one Square to a different Square. These Locations can be adjacent, but they cannot occupy the same Square. This Keyword does not inherently have a distance that these Objects can be moved, so it still requires ACP Investment in the Range Keyword. An Object moving from one Square to another does build momentum nor cause Collision unless the Object was already in motion such as a Volley Action, or falling.

Transporting Characters and Objects of varying Size Ranks depends entirely on the amount of Squares they Occupy, and just as it is depicted in the Size Rank Page, Four Tiny, 2 Small, or 1 Medium Character or Object can be Transported at one time for 12 ACP. Beyond that point, ACP cost is increased by 4 ACP per Square per Character or Object they occupy. As an example, with 24 ACP invested in Travel II (2 Characters), 24 ACP invested for Size Rank, and 12 ACP invested in Range (60 ACP). That Character could transport up to two Large Characters, 4 Long Characters, 8 Medium Characters, 16 Small Characters or 32 Tiny Characters up to 20 ft. 

Transporting Characters and Objects through the Travel Keyword does not require it be depicted through portals and holes in space. How it appears, is just important on how its described and how it functions within the rules of the game. Transporting a target, such as an unwilling Character or an held Object results in a Power Resolve versus Legerity.

Created Abilities will be in this format when displayed.

Core: Body, Mind, or Spirit
Drawback: How much Drawback this Ability has (up to half the maximum)
Slot: Half, Single, or Double
Type: 'Active, Trigger, or Passive; plus the Core Action required to use the ability.
Aspect: 'Damage, Heal, Shield, Boost or Hinderance; determines how it affects the Target. Plus sub-type
Device: 'Required availability and functionality in order for the Ability to be used.
Range: 'Determines what targets are eligible as long as they are within range of the user.
Target: 'Natural, Self, or Single Target determines what other Characters can be chosen.
Effect Value: 'Determines the result of the Ability based on what Keywords the Character chose.
Keyword: 'The Keywords create a structure for the Ability and provides limitations based on ACP Investment.
Description: 'Important for the Characters theme and concept as the design is governed by it.

It's really important that the structure of Abilities follow the format above. So the Ability can easily be understood.
