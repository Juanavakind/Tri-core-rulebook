Tri-Core is a tabletop roleplaying game that focuses on the creation and customization of unique characters, and storylines. Players will utilize the Tri-Core Ability Creation System to mold and craft all of their abilities and features that define their characters. As well as an intuitive resource system that will allow for an Action Economy that rewards both reckless and careful characters alike. The Tri-Core Combat System will enable players to also compete against one another through fair and balanced gameplay while simultaneously adding the much desired, element of surprise.

However, Tri-Core’s greatest feature is the Action Card System, in which Players will transcribe the abilities they create onto blank Action Cards and among those cards are Strike, Volley, Grab, Collide, Block, Dodge, and Parry. In addition players will have access to Utility Cards that provide actions to support their characters and the abilities they have. Each player, during a cycle, will place their set of Cards face down and reveal them on the same cycle. Allowing this gives the players a chance to access and utilize the element of surprise, even versus the GM(Gamemaster).

Players will pay for these Actions Cards with Action Points, Stamina, Focus, Mana and even Health Points (If necessary) to complete their actions and hope for success. Tri-Core can also allow for the transfer of abilities, features and spells from any source material using the Ability Creation System. However, the level in which these abilities may be acquired will not always be in alignment and Tri-Core does not deal in Absolutes. With that said, let it be known that in Tri-Core, everything has an equal chance to fail just as much as it can succeed. So thank you for choosing to play Tri-Core, and once more…

Thank you for choosing to play Tri-Core!

They may decide to the Characters in their story should be like Superheroes and allow 9d10 or even 9d12 to be rolled for Characters.

Alternatively, a GM may not want players to roll stats at all and instead allocate their stats with a pool of points. If so, then 24 total points is what should be allowed for an array similar to what will typically occur when rolling 9d4.

The Standard Array for a level one Character is 9d6 and three +2
Bonuses at 1st Level, 5th Level, and 10th Level. A GM may choose to alter or modify the Standard Array rolled for newly created Characters as they choose, typically dependent on the campaign setting.

Players have the option of increasing their stats through a variety of ways, such as rolling and allocating stats, applying level up bonuses at 5th and 10th level, creating Passive Abilities that increase stats of their choice, as well as equipment they create or loot as they journey throughout the campaign.

Below is a list of Tiers that the GM may choose to change what stats are rolled for the Players as they create their character, representing a different scale in growth.

Commoner: An ordinary person, without rank or title – 9d4 and three plus one bonuses

Adventurer: A person who enjoys or seeks adventure and take risks, using various effective methods for personal gain. – 9d6 and three plus two bonuses

Heroic: A person who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities – 9d8 and three plus three bonuses

Legendary: A very well known and or extremely famous or notorious person, especially in a particular field. A living legend. – 9d10 and three plus four bonuses

Mythic: A person or thing having a perceived imaginary or unverifiable existence, that embodies an ideal or faith. – 9d12 and three plus five bonuses

Health Points or HP is what determines how much damage a character can take before they fall unconscious or even die. A characters total HP is an accumulation between Vitality, Endurance, Finesse, Ardor and Morale. Plus they gain 15 HP per level starting at level 1, and if they choose they may increase it through Abilities and Items. A character may suffer two effects if they receive too much damage in one instance. This is called a Threshold which is equal to 50% of their total Health Points. If they do, they must roll Resolve and the result must equal or greater to the total damage received. The type of Resolve rolled depends on the type of damage received. If they fail, then they suffer the effect, Shock. When in Shock, a character will lose their total Action Points regardless of how many Action Points they currently have.
-
Action Points or AP determines how many actions a character may take during combat, encounters or challenges. Each character has a base of 6 Action points plus the sum of Vitality, Intelligence, and Ardor. Any character may use Action Points beyond zero and dip into negative Action Points. However, they may suffer effects as they head to fatigue, exhaustion, and unconsciousness. For each point in negative Action Points, the character reduces their total AP once they use the Recover Action. If a character ever reaches their Total AP in negative AP, they immediately and unavoidably fall unconscious for 1d12 cycles minimum 1 cycle (duration reduced by Vitality). An Alternate Rule (GM’s choice) can allow characters to perform and complete Actions even when they are out of Resources such as Stamina, Focus or Mana. If they do, they will take backlash damage to their HP equal to 2d12 per Resource point used. (Backlash bypasses damage reduction)
-
Stamina Points or SP is what determines how many times an Ability Action associated with the Body Stat can be used per day. Each character has a base total of Power, Vitality, and Endurance.
-
Focus Points or FP is what determines how many times an Ability Action associated with the Mind Stat can be used per day. Each character has a base total of Intelligence, Acuity, and Finesse.
-
Mana Points or MP is what determines how many times an Ability Action associated with the Spirit Stat can be used per day. Each character has a base that total of Ardor, Morale, and Attunement.
-
Resource points are recovered (100%) at the end of a long rest (8 Hours or more), however, any character may make a short rest (4 hours) to recover half (50%) of their resources regardless of their current totals. Any character that suffered Shock or fell unconscious due to debilitating trauma will recover Resources at a reduced rate. They will only recover 50% after a long rest, and 25% after a short rest on the following day.
-
Whether it’s a Long Rest or a Short Rest, only one of each may be chosen per day. It’s up to the GM’s discretion on what constitutes the end of day and how many rests you’ll be allowed. Any action cannot be completed if a character lacks the resources, that includes additional resources or costs Abilities may have when created or chosen.
REACT, ROTATION & RESOLVE
React is an Action that allows any character to perform an Action in reaction to another Character. React costs 1 Action Point and is equal to the sum of Power, Finesse, and Attunement. React is also required when determining which character may take their turn first. This is called Priority and is given to the character at the top of the Rotation. 
-
A Character receives 1 Reaction plus an additional 1 Reaction per two points in Acuity.
-
The order of rotation is determined by highest to lowest in totals for rolled React. When a character has Priority, they can choose to perform one Action without expending an additional Action Point to do so. Any other character capable, may choose to React and perform an Action if they choose to. Any character, if capable, can perform a string of actions depending on the type of action and the costs. Being knowingly targeted by the Character with Priority, grants you a free Action as a reaction. A character may only React and affect another character that's within range of an Item, Equipment, Object, Ability or Action they have. 
-
As an example, Character A has priority and chooses to perform a Strike Action and Character B has been targeted by Character A. Character B is not required to spend an additional Action Point but is allowed one Action in reaction to Character A's Strike. Though Character B is not aware what action Character A will be taking. Character C is an ally of Character B and chooses to assist Character B by spending an additional Action Point to act out of rotation in defense of Character B.
-
Physical Guard (PR), Mental Fortitude (MF), and Energy Resistance (ER) reduce incoming damage and effects that align with the type of Effect Value (Physical, Mental, or Energy). PR, MF, and ER can be increased by Abilities, Armor, and Items.
Resolve is a reaction to effects that affect a Character in a variety but specific ways, and can be resisted through rolling a 2d12 plus a Core-stat and is determined by each individual effect. These effects can be produced by the environment or by another Character. (Resolve does not cost Action Points)
-
POWER: Effects that force a Character to move
VITALITY: Effects that modify Resources (HP, SP, FP, and MP)
ENDURANCE: Effects that modify Action Points
INTELLIGENCE: Effects that force a Character to use Action Points
ACUITY: Effects that modify a Characters Accuracy
FINESSE: Area of effects that require a Character's avoidance
ARDOR: Effects that modify a Characters Speed Rank
MORALE: Effects that modify Effect Values
ATTUNEMENT: Effects that modify a Characters sense & senses
-
The Challenge Level (CL) of a Resolve is determined by the total Core-stat plus 4 plus Character Level or Challenge Level, depending on the source of the effect. As an example, a level One Character with 10 in Body will have a CL of 14 and would require the Resolving character to roll at minimum 14 in order to resist the effect.
-
When a Character Succeeds or fails on a Resolve, the Effect is increased or reduced based on that success or failure. A critical success is determined if the characters resolve exceeds the CL by 20 or more. A success must be equal or greater, and no more than 1 to 19 points higher in total than the CL. A failure is 1 less or more, between 1 to 19 less than the CL and a Critical Failure is 20 points or lower than the CL.
-
CRITICAL SUCCESS: Effect reduced by 100%
SUCCESS: Effect reduced by 50%
FAILURE: Full effect
CRITICAL FAILURE: Effect increased by 100%
-
Damage mitigation applies when a character receives damage that targets Health Points or Action Points and only applies once damage is taken. Any Actions or Abilities that reduce damage taken such as Block and Dodge will reduce the incoming damage first and whatever is left over is reduced by Armor (Physical, Mental, and Energy). Damage received can be reduced to Zero and damage will affect Shielding and Temporary HP first before Health Points. Threshold is base total Health Points only and does not include Shielding or a temporary increase to Health Points.
